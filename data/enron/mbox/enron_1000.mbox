So,  I think Jason is going to go to the game now.  So, I need to buy you and 
Mom tickets.  Before I do that, do you have any friends at UH or UT (maybe 
Mr. Hamilton) that might have tickets.  If not, we can get some through a 
ticket broker or through a scalper the day of the game (probably the better 
way).  

Let me know

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Importance:	High

Mary Kay asked me to relay the following comments.  Elizabeth suggested I put them in an E-mail so that the Houston group could discuss sat 3:30.

1.  Item #1 PDT record (roughly page 109)
On TI contract #26849 for 8/18/2001-8/20/2001, report shows scheduled & delivered  volume of 1068 with NO nominated volume.
Elizabeth suspects that this was manually scheduled overrun.  
If that is the case, Mary Kay recommends that you make the Nominated column match the volume in the Scheduled column.

2.  Item #3 Footnote #3
Mary Kay suggested the following wording.  Do you agree that this describes what happened?
She is assuming that this was still related to the Force Majeur with Gallup being down, since Operating Capacity went down
from 8/19 to 8/20 then back up on 8/21.

"After operating for a day under the Force Majeure, physical mainline capacity was adjusted based on operating conditions."

Lynn,
I am working on a presentation for Dave Neubauer and I am needing an example of a SMS chart to include in the power point presentation.  Do you have a chart that you could e-mail to me, so that I could include it in the presentation. It doesn't matter which of the 4 charts you send. Thanks!
Courtney Barker
Call me at (402) 398-7130, if you have any questions.

bearish still but a matter of timing.  current rally a function of reshaping the curve with incremental stg still available to ecourage economic withdraws come december.  think recent increase in bullish fundamental situation is more a result of price (1.80 in bid week) than anything else.  Think that with this bidweek being, as we stand now, above resid and above the coal stack, fundamentals worsen considerably to the point where price must go down.  Still very bearish first half '02.

Happy St. Patrick's Day!
I'm moving this weekend to another apartment in the same complex.  We're
overlooking the pool now, so stop by and visit.  I've attached the new
address.  Phone numbers will remain the same.

Things here in Houston are going well.  I'm going to Eastern Europe March
29-April 11.  The tentative schedule is Budapest, Prague, Munich, Salzberg,
Vienna, and Marseille.  The weekend after I get back is the MS-150 bike ride

from Houston to Austin, so wish me luck!


Hope all's well,
Brian

Here is lakeside in your format.  Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note.  My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering.  Also expenses were higher.  Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management?

 

I would like to come see it again on Wednesday.  I would be bringing 1 or 2 others.  Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am?

Phillip

Bush Adviser Rove Owns Stock in Major U.S. Firms
By Jim VandeHei
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- President Bush's chief political strategist owns hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the president's top legislative priorities, newly released federal records show. 
Karl Rove, one of the president's most trusted advisers on almost every major legislative initiative, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of stock in Enron Corp., Pfizer Inc., General Electric Co., Boeing Co. and Johnson & Johnson, among other holdings. (Federal law requires public officials to report their assets, income and debts in broad ranges only). All of these companies could be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on which the president consults Mr. Rove: tax cuts, increased defense spending, an industry-oriented energy policy and health-care reform.
Mr. Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to pay capital-gains taxes, as permitted by federal law. In the meantime, "I have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially affect my specific holdings," Mr. Rove said. 
Mr. Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec. 30 and was later informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
But the government ethics office, which couldn't be reached for comment yesterday, has yet to officially grant Mr. Rove a certificate of divestiture, which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts, according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack. It appears that Mr. Rove has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year. 
Mr. Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that directly affect companies he is invested in, as federal conflict-of-interest laws require. But that can't be easy for Mr. Rove, widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the White House. Mr. Rove serves as the president's top political adviser and runs the administration's long-term strategy team. He is also the president's top liaison to outside groups, including corporations. 
"He's involved in virtually every decision that is made here," says a White House aide. It is unclear how many times, if ever, Mr. Rove recused himself from discussion inside the White House. 
President Bush, already under fire from Democrats for his administration's close ties to industry, is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and major U.S. corporations, especially energy firms. 
The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr. Rove and several other top administration officials at the behest of the media. It appears that as a result of an administrative backlog, Mr. Rove is the only member of the senior staff who hasn't been given the green light to sell his stock, according to a White House aide. 
The reports show that Mr. Rove was one of several White House officials with a financial connection, past or present, with Enron and other energy companies. Larry Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser who helped draft the energy plan, received $50,000 from Enron in 2000 for consulting work he did for the company, the documents show. 
Lewis Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chairman of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan, recently sold tens of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies, including Texaco Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. It is unclear when the transaction went through. 
Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding between $100,000 and $250,000 in El Paso Energy Partners LP. And National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice had $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Chevron Corp. stock and was paid $60,000 last year for her work as a director at the company. Mr. Rove disclosed smaller holdings in BP PLC and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.

International
Saudi Arabia Sets Pacts With 9 Oil Firms

06/04/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine oil companies yesterday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in its energy sector since the industry was nationalized in the 1970s. 
The expected deal, valued at $25 billion at least, involves the development of three natural-gas fields in the kingdom, as well as a number of related power plants, transmission pipelines and water-desalinization projects.
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the lead manager on two of the projects, including the $15 billion Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead the Red Sea Coast Core Venture 2 project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group was chosen to lead the Shaybah Core Venture 3 project. 
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil for export. 
The other companies selected were BP PLC, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc., Phillips Petroleum Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Enron Corp. and Marathon Oil Canada Inc. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity owner in the projects. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 after tension caused by the Arab oil embargo against the West that began two years earlier, and it closed its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Exxon Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country, and it said it is also the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine international oil companies Sunday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in its energy sector since nationalizing the industry in 1975. 
The deals, worth a total of $25 billion or more, involve the development of three natural gas fields in the kingdom and a number of related power plants, transmission pipelines and water desalinization projects.
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil-burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil for export. 
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the lead manager on two of the projects, including the $12-billion-to-$16-billion Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead a second core project. Royal Dutch/Shell was chosen to lead a third project. The last two projects have a value of $7 billion to $10 billion each, Prince Saud al Faisal told reporters. 
The other companies selected were BP of Britain, TotalFinaElf of France, Conoco Inc. of Houston, Phillips Petroleum Co. of Bartlesville, Okla., Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, Enron Corp. of Houston and Marathon Oil Co. of Houston. 
Harry Longwell, director and senior vice president at Exxon Mobil, said the financial terms of the deal are still being discussed. But he said his company is ready to begin the work when the final contracts are signed. 
"The Saudis' expectations are extremely aggressive," Longwell said. "It's a very tight schedule and in recognition of that, the ability to get this done is one of the key reasons we were chosen to lead two of these ventures. We already have a senior management team in place and are ready to go to work immediately." 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said the companies are expected to profit on returns from the exploration and development of gas fields with more than 15% of the investment cost. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity owner in the projects. 
Saud said if the companies discover oil, they will be compensated and the fields will be repossessed by Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 and closed its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country and is the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.

WASHINGTON INSIGHT
Gloom today, glut tomorrow

A.19
(Copyright 2001)

WHAT GOES UP usually comes down. And few industries are more prone to boom and bust than energy. 
Imagine the news stories a few years from now: "Crisis hangover -- energy stocks sink as prices plunge; But California consumers still stuck with high bills."
"The energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of the 1990s, as dozens of big new power plants come on line, and the just-completed Alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest levels in six years. 
"The one bright spot for Texas generators is California, where consumers are locked into long-term contracts for wholesale electricity that the state signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of 2001. 
"Sacramento lawmakers have appealed to President Daschle to help get the state off the hook, arguing that California will never claw its way out of its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is cheap. 
"But top Enron lobbyist Gray Davis, a former governor of California, warned Daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce the contracts the state signed." 
Washington and Sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the seams with plans to fix it. But the one thing no one - - even environmentalists -- suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy consumption or encourage new supplies. 
"To economists, letting the price rise is the solution," said Paul Portney, president of Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank. "To elected representatives, having the price go up is the problem." 
Political memories tend to be selective and short. But it was the energy glut of the 1990s that contributed to California's blackouts, $3 gasoline and $400-a-month heating bills. Likewise, high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction. 
As a story in the New York Times noted, an energy investment boom "promises a cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices in coming months, many industry executives and private analysts say." 
Through much of the 1990s, there was a glut of energy. Fuel of all kinds was really cheap. 
How cheap? Adjusted for inflation, as cheap as in 1949, economists calculate. 
Energy is the oxygen of the economy, and rock-bottom prices contributed to the long economic boom. But low prices also caused energy production to slump and consumption to soar. 
People ditched their economy cars for SUVs. Houses got bigger, ceilings got higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough BTUs to melt aluminum. Stores, offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators. 
Low prices discouraged energy development. 
"Oil was so cheap for so long, that people were selling their refineries," Portney said. "You had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when prices were at $2 a BTU." 
As demand soared and supply fell, prices rose. Profits have grown so robust that green fuels, such as biomass and wind, are becoming economically viable. The oil industry is booming. Refineries are expanding. The long-delayed construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska now looks likely. So many power plants are under construction that the market may be flooded with as much as 200,000 new megawatts by 2004. 
Investments in energy efficiency -- from new-age superconducting transmission wires to better light bulbs -- are suddenly looking attractive for the first time in decades. 
"High prices will dampen demand, high prices will encourage supply, and will encourage people to make better use of what they've got," said Robert Ebel, director of energy for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "So we're starting on the down slope. We're not very far down. When prices start to decline, I can't say how far they will go. But they will decline, because that's just the law of supply and demand. Prices decline, demand starts to creep up again, there's less incentive to add to supply, and here we go again."

INDIA: Rating firms may be judging India harshly-analysts.
By Vidya Ranganathan

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Analysts have reacted with surprise to last week's decision of ratings agency Fitch to cut India's sovereign ratings outlook to negative from stable, and say there are no grounds to downgrade the country. 
Fitch, which rates India's foreign currency obligations at BB-plus, a notch above Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, cited concerns about fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in foreign investment climate.
However, economists speculated it could either be on account of Fitch adjusting its ratings in line with other global agencies, or a fallout of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's threat to exit an Indian power venture over payments problems. 
Moody's and S&P said on Friday they have not revised ratings or outlook but are disappointed with fiscal reform efforts. 
Local currency and stock markets reacted nervously to the announcement, but economists said most concerns were exaggerated. 
"When the direction of reforms is positive and government flows are improving, the outlook should not change," said Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at local rating agency CARE Ltd. 
Even if the provocation for the rating review was the Enron episode, analysts said the problems were specific to the power sector and will not affect the robust foreign investment the country has been receiving. 
"Enron was a bad deal, made on unreasonable terms in the first place and does not reflect the ability of the government to pay its dues," said an economist with a U.S.-based fund. 
Some of the confusion arises from the various ratings assigned to India. 
Moody's has retained a positive outlook on its Ba2 rating since late 1999, while S&P has a stable outlook and a BB rating. 
CONCERNS OVERSTATED 
Analysts said none of the factors Fitch cited had deteriorated in the past year, since it first rated India. 
Fitch said India's fiscal-monetary mix was unfavorable, real interest rates were high and there was the risk of a debt trap. 
India marginally overshot its budgeted fiscal deficit in 2000/01 (April-March) to 5.2 percent of GDP, down from the previous year's 5.6 percent. 
But laws to control government spending are awaiting parliament's approval, there are incentives for disciplined state governments and a determined effort at privatising state-run firms has begun. 
Burgeoning fiscal deficits have persisted for a decade and public debt at 60 percent of GDP is high, but at six percent annual growth, India is one of the fastest expanding economies in Asia. 
"In terms of external liquidity, India is much stronger than its BB+ rating while even its public debt to GDP ratio is lower than that of some Asian nations," said P.K. Basu, chief economist for South East Asia at Credit Suisse First Boston, Singapore. 
Foreign investment has been pouring in - portfolio flows at $2.2 billion so far in 2001 are at record levels and compare with $1.56 billion for the whole of 2000 - and foreign exchange reserves are strong at $42.8 billion. 
Interest rates and yields have also dropped, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) adopting an aggressive easing stance this year to prop the slowing economy, and inflation is benign. 
"The hardest initial steps are being taken and there is still a lot of inertia, but soon there will be a willing audience and reforms can progress faster," CARE's Nagarajan said. 
But critics said the changes were still very superficial and structural reforms that would spur long-term growth and demand were lacking. 
"What the rating agencies have emphasised is fiscal consolidation, which means better revenue streams, efficient expenses, user charges for public utilities...we promised these three years back and haven't moved very far on those," said Saumitra Chaudhari, economist with local rating agency ICRA Ltd. 
"We still do not have a securities bill, mature debt market and our banks have not cleaned up,".

INDIA: India rupee ends off lows, fwds close higher.

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - The rupee ended unchanged on Monday, recovering from the day's low after a large European bank sold dollars, dealers said. 
It had slipped to a low of 47.04 per dollar in early deals on dollar purchases by a jewellery importer.
The rupee ended at steady at d47.01/02 per dollar. 
Dealers said there was no impact of Friday's comments from international rating agencies which had raised concerns over continuity of foreign investment and dragged shares lower. 
The currency recovered from lows around 47.085 on Friday, reacting to international rating agency Fitch's revision in the outlook for India's ratings on sovereign debt to negative from stable, citing worries about fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. 
Later, rating firms Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) said they were disappointed over the government's reform effort. 
Moody's also raised a concern about India's Maharashtra state utility's ongoing tussle with Houston-based Enron Corp and said: "the dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations". 
It added this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country. 
The comments weighed on bond prices, which extended losses on Monday, and in turn led to paying in dollar forwards. 
"After a long gap, there was corporate paying interest in forwards today," a dealer with a state-run bank said. 
The six-month forward ended at an annualised 5.10 percent compared with Friday's 4.95.

UK: Spectron trades UK's first post-NETA spark spread.

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Energy brokerage Spectron said late on Friday it had traded the first brokered gas-electricity arbitrage, or "spark spread", deal in the UK since the launch in March this year of new electricity trading arrangements (NETA). 
"Now that liquidity has returned to the electricity market post NETA, such transactions are expected to become more common...", said Spectron in a statement.
The deal was concluded between UK utility Powergen and U.S. energy group Enron . 
Spectron said the trade, covering winter 2002, was for 60 megawatts of electricity at 21.42 pounds a megawatt hour and for 100,000 therms of gas at 24.85 pence a therm. 
The winter period specified in the deal ran from October 1 to March 31. 
For the electricity, one day was defined as 2300 hours to 2300 hours. 
For the gas, one day was 0600 hours to 0600 hours. 
The deal comes as the industry moves to create standard terms and conditions for spark spreads. 
Powergen is due to meet in mid-June with other traders, including Aquila Energy , for talks aimed at agreeing standard terms. 
"It is hoped that the market will soon establish standardised documentation leading to a standardised product that will help promote liquidity in one or more levels of efficiency," said Spectron.

INDIA: Enron India lenders meet in Singapore on Tuesday.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Lenders to Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol Power Company begin a two-day meeting in Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle differences over continued support to a controversial $2.9 billion power project in India. 
Representatives of some of the world's largest banks like Citibank , ABN AMRO , and Bank of America, will be at the meeting. Indian lenders like the Industrial Development Bank of India , State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate.
Market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint stand on supporting the project which now produces 740 MW of power and is slated to increase it to 2,184 MW shortly in its second phase. 
But it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which is the sole buyer of Dabhol's electricity. 
Indian lenders, who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant, want to continue supporting the project. 
But they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their loans. Loans of around $638 million of the offshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions. 
The Indian lenders, fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull the plug, plan to oppose any such move. 
But they have been forced on the backfoot by MSEB's decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and terminate its 1995 contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output. 
The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth $48 million. 
Last month, Dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power. It has also filed for arbitration in London. This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol before a local regulatory body, the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration proceedings. 
The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign investors. 
Last week, global rating agency Moody's expressed concern over slippage in the Indian government's reform programme and cited the Enron's dispute as an example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors. 
"The dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations. As a consequence, this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country," Moody's said. 
India's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interview with Reuters on Sunday. 
"India is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are respected," he said. "There is no need for concern." ($1 = 47 Indian rupees).

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase.
By Clarence Fernandez

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - India's reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase, with plans afoot to free up private supply, overhaul debt-ridden state utilities and recraft tariffs, Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters. 
With investors' fears fanned by a squabble between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and a local utility, Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is standing behind international contracts.
"Sanctity of contracts has to be kept," Prabhu said. 
The row began late last year when the utility in western Maharashtra state defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron. The 2,184 MW power project is India's largest foreign investment, at $2.9 billion. 
Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction. 
"Absolutely," he said in reply to a question whether India's reforms have entered a different phase. The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribution, he added, besides its early preoccupation with generation needs. 
"In India unfortunately for the last 10 years...reforms policy was skewed in favour of generation," he said. "We never really realised that distribution is the more important part of the process." 
Prabhu added, "We have now decided we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made." 
CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT 
A chartered accountant, Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of India's western coastal strand, and chaired a co-operative bank that was one of the country's largest, in terms of deposits, before his foray into politics. 
An errant lock of hair straying across his forehead, Prabhu eschews the Indian politician's traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government, and whom local media call "technocrats". 
Prabhu said India has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers, lifting curbs that have hobbled the country's decade-old reform effort. 
He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask India's states to permit third-party sales of power, which analysts have called a stumbling-block for foreign investment. 
"They cannot force a generator to sell power only to the SEBs, and that's a major change we are trying to make," Prabhu said, referring to the states. 
SEBs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments, and supply power to most of India. 
India estimates that 100,000 MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next 12 years to meet its power needs. Most of the $200 billion in funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment. 
But India's spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wary. Bureaucratic procedures, legal delays and political wrangling have held up reform moves. 
RATING REVISED TO NEGATIVE 
Last week global rating agency Fitch revised India's sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable, citing fiscal concerns, the slow pace of privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. Competing agency Moody's sees signs of slippage in the reforms, and Standard & Poor's has expressed worries over India's budget deficit. 
Prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting policies, cutting transmission and distribution losses to 15 percent, and tackling crushing debt, thus helping to lure foreign investment into the sector. 
The poor financial health of the utilities, expected to run up combined losses of about $6 billion in the 2001/02 fiscal year, has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment. 
Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances - looking at technical, commercial and tariff issues - is expected to report within a few weeks. 
"For the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is internationally accepted. We will be preparing technical data which is internationally appreciable. And thirdly, we'll be creating an information base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states," he said. 
The utilities' transmission and distribution losses run to up to 25 percent of the electricity they generate, compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally, he said. 
Prabhu wants to trim this to about 15 percent within two or three years. 
"In the case of India, I am willing to accept a figure of 14 percent to 15 percent, because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but commercially unviable," he added. 
Other steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern region with the rest of India, efforts to boost plant load factors through modernisation of equipment, and to persuade people to use energy more efficiently. 
Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves through a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap, or even free, as many did in the past. ($1=47 Indian rupees).

Nigerian president slams US energy firm Enron for "poor performance"

06/04/2001
BBC Monitoring
Source: The Guardian web site, Lagos, in English 4 Jun 01/BBC Monitoring/(c) BBC

Text of article by Francis Obinor entitled: "Obasanjo chides Enron on Lagos power project"; published by Nigerian newspaper The Guardian web site on 4 June 
For failing to live up to expectation of the Nigerian government and the people as regard its role in the Independent Power Project (IPP) initiated by the Lagos State government two years ago, Enron, the American firm got a hard knock from President Olusegun Obasanjo at the weekend [2-3 June].
In his conclusion, Obasanjo accused Enron, a major player in the electricity project, of poor performance and bad faith. Ostensibly angry at the delay in the project's full take-off and the 30 MW recently connected to the national grid from the scheme, the president on the American Cable News Network (CNN) declared: "Enron has played a dirty game on us. Dirty game in two ways." 
Beside putting up an exorbitant price, the company according to the president, also failed to comply with the terms of the contract. Continuing, Obasanjo said: "The price at which they (Enron) have tried to sell power to us has been very exorbitant. Two, what they told us they would do, they have not done." 
While refusing to disclose the firm's charges, Enron Vice-President of Marketing John Ambler said the primary objective of the company was to get the project on stream. "We have a project that is very close to coming on line," he said, stressing that the company's desire is to see the project work effectively in Nigeria, especially in Lagos. He added that Enron is committed to the IPP and assured Lagosians that they would soon begin to feel the impact. 
The state government brought forward the June 2001 deadline it set for the commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first 30 MW of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago. 
At the Government House on 23 May, Governor Bola Tinubu said his administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in bringing the date forward and assured that another 30 MW would be added soon. He noted that, contrary to expectations that the project would cover the entire state at a go, it would be in phases and the focus for now would be industrial consumption. "The concentration for now is not as private homes, we would soon get there," Tinubu assured. 
The controversial IPP programme, which the federal government had at one time been accused of frustrating, has suffered several setbacks, including Enron's initial plan to sell its shares to AES, another American company. Last April was originally fixed for the project's take-off but the failure of Trevi, a construction company in charge of transmitters, caused a shift in the date.

India: India and Bush Administration: Beyond assumptions

06/04/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence Wire

SOON after Mr George W. Bush Jr. won the US elections, Indian observers proclaimed quickly that a Republican administration bodes good for India. A Republican administration was expected to not pester India about human rights violations in Kashmir, not force it to sign the CTBT, and get tougher with China. 
Mr George Bush's decision to "drop by" the External Affairs Minister, Mr Jaswant Singh's meeting with the American National Security Advisor, Ms Condoleezza Rice, seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria. This narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of Republican ideology. The reality is the Republicans care about a range of issues that will force the BJP Government to make some difficult decisions.
Take the first issue of human rights violations in Kashmir. It is true there are many isolationists in the Republican Party who, probably, do not care about human rights violation in Kashmir so long as it does not affect them, and is not happening in their backyard. But there is another powerful force in Republican politics - the religious wing. This includes powerful members of the US Cabinet such as The Attorney-General, Mr John Ashcroft, who are Christian fundamentalists. 
Mr Bush himself claims to be a 'born again Christian'. 
The religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy; it mostly concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage pregnancy. But the few times it does intervene, it is when it feels a country is "persecuting Christians". And when it does intervene, no Republican administration dares cross it. 
For instance, China is periodically identified as a country that persecutes Christians. Christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion. Because of this issue, Republican members of the Christian right in Congress have all but declared a religious war on China, routinely opposing any attempt to improve relations - including trade relations - with that country. 
India, as an emerging power, is more carefully watched, and frequently mentioned in the American press. Stories of Christian missionaries being burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to "elements associated with the Hindu fundamentalist ruling party". In its latest human rights report, the US State Department noted these acts with concern. 
The Pope's mention of these issues to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was also noted in the American press. India is, perhaps, half a step away from being branded as a country that "persecutes Christians". 
A self-professed born-again Christian like Mr George Bush would quickly take up the Christian right's cause, trumping all other bilateral issues. Human rights may not matter to the isolationists, but Christian, and to a lesser extent Jewish, religious freedom matters tremendously to a Republican administration. 
The second fallacy was that since the Republicans in Congress did not pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, they would not force other countries to pass the CTBT either. But why are the Republicans are opposed to the CTBT. The opponents of the CTBT feel that it fails to safeguard American security. They frankly care little about Indian security. They would love to be able to restrict India's ability to test and use its weapons. To them, nuclear weapons not in American hands translates into an unsafe world. Unless India manages to convince the Republicans otherwise, the Republican administration is likely to tighten the anti-proliferation screws on India. 
The third fallacy relates to a tough, long-term strategic re-alignment the Bush Administration will demand of India. Mr Bush's foreign policy-makers are unreconstructed 'Cold Warriors'. In the post-Cold War era, they are desperately "searching for an enemy". They appear to have settled on China as "the next enemy". Their next step is to search for "allies" 
who rarely challenge their views. Thinkers in Washington and New Delhi believe that India and the US are "natural allies". But such a decision has an enormous range of long-term consequences for India. 
To discuss just a few: Most of the Indian military's equipment comes from Russia and the former Soviet Union. Allying with the US will be seen by the Russians as abandoning them, and this could have an enormous impact on the legacy military equipment. Recent noises from the Foreign Ministry suggest India is also eager about Mr George Bush's proposed missile defence programme. But this technology is far from proven, and during the decade over which it may be developed (if it gets past Congress), China will most certainly develop many nuclear weapons. These may, primarily, be a deterrent against the US, but it will force India into an arms buildup it can barely afford. 
The Americans are reserving their missile defence system for their "closest allies". India today is neither fish nor fowl - not quite a threat, but not quite an ally either. It is unlikely that India will be able to convince the Americans to give it the defence system. 
Even if the Americans agree to sell it to India, it could never afford the sticker price. So, before it rejoices at the notion of anti-China hawks in the White House, let India ponder over the unexamined consequences. 
The final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term. 
Enron and Maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to lose, and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller. Mr George Bush's background is as a Texas oilman - and he is widely accused in the US of being beholden to the interests of the energy industry. 
In fact, they were among the biggest "contributors to his campaign". 
The Enron Chairman, Mr Kenneth Lay, is a friend of Mr Bush's, and was seriously considered for a job in his Cabinet. He is so well connected that he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the White House to regulate the energy industry. In the near term, Mr Bush could quite possibly lean heavily on New Delhi to "make sure that Enron's interests are not neglected". If New Delhi does not respond to his satisfaction, his opinion of India, and consequently, his administration's dealings with the country, are likely to be coloured far more than we think.

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project
2001-06-04 08:41 (New York)

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project

     Mumbai, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Indian banks that loaned money
to Dabhol Power Corp., the local unit of Enron Corp., will try and
persuade their international counterparts to keep alive the $3
billion project at a meeting of lenders in Singapore tomorrow.
    The two-day meeting will be the first between the two groups
of bankers since they met in London on April 24-25 to discuss an
escalating dispute on power prices that has pitted Enron against
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's only customer.
     ``We will discuss how we can go about resolving the
problem,'' R.S. Agarwal, executive director at Industrial
Development Bank of India, or IDBI, said. IDBI is the biggest
lender to the Dabhol project.
     The outcome of the Singapore meeting, to be held in the
offices of ABN Amro Holding NV, one of the biggest international
lenders to the project, will be crucial to the banks, which have
loaned as much as $2 billion to Dabhol.
     Indian banks fear the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's
decision to stop buying power from Dabhol may strengthen
international lenders' resolve to terminate the project and invoke
government guarantees to recover their loans.
     ``Foreign lenders want to close the (Dabhol) chapter,'' said
Pradyumna Kaul, an activist with Enron Virodhi Andolan, a non-
government organization opposed to the project. ``They are eager
to call in their loans, even if it means taking a 10 to 15 percent
cut, rather than spend more on supervision and legal expenses
while watching the saga linger.''
     Local banks such as IDBI are most at risk as the Maharashtra
and federal governments have guaranteed only foreign banks' loans
of about $600 million to the venture.
     IDBI alone has exposure totaling 21.58 billion rupees ($460
million) to the project, including 15.28 billion rupees in
guarantees.
     Foreign lenders such as ABN Amro, Citibank N.A., a unit of
Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and Credit Suisse First Boston in
April approved Dabhol's decision to begin termination of its power
supply contract with the board. They are in favor of canceling the
project.
     India's government risks having to pay 170 billion rupees in
fines, resulting from guarantees it has offered on payments and
loans, if Enron pulls out of the project.

                             The Fight

     Maharashtra State Electricity Board Wednesday stopped buying
power from Dabhol as the dispute escalated. The board on May 24
told Dabhol Power Co. it was canceling its power purchase
contract, six days after Dabhol gave the board notice it was set
to pull out of the project because of the six-month dispute over
bills owed by the board.
     ``The MSEB's move has complicated the matter. We did not
expect MSEB to do this,'' Agarwal at IDBI said last week.
     Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, and the board are in
dispute over 3 billion rupees in unpaid bills for December and
January. Others bills through March have been paid.
     The board has refused to pay the December and January bills,
saying they should be lowered to reflect a 4 billion rupee penalty
the board imposed on Dabhol for not supplying power at full
capacity on Jan. 28.
     The dispute Thursday prompted debt-rating company Fitch to
change its outlook on India to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' Fitch
said the climate for foreign investors has deteriorated.
     ``The dispute indicates that India's government may not be
willing to live up to its contractual obligation,'' the Economic
Times quoted Kristin Lindow, India analyst at Moody's Investors
Service, as saying. ``As a consequence, this would further deter
foreign director investment from coming into the country.''
     Moody's and Standard & Poor's have stable outlooks on the
country's sovereign rating. S&P has an investment grade rating of
``BBB'' on the country's sovereign debt. Moody's, like Fitch,
rates India's debt as junk at ``BB2.''



Enron Japan's Hirl on Power Deregulation: Commodity Comment
2001-06-04 06:29 (New York)


     Sydney, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Joseph Hirl, chief executive of
Enron Corp.'s Japanese unit, Enron Japan Corp., comments on the
outlook for deregulation of Japan's electricity industry. He spoke
at the Coaltrans Asia conference in Sydney.

On Japanese government policy:
     ``The government does have a strong commitment to
deregulation, but there are some significant policy concerns''
including a ``greater than 80 percent reliance on imports'' of
energy.
     ``The market has been open a bit over a year, however not
much has happened. No genuine competition exists under the current
system. The companies there recognize that it will happen. It's
inevitable.
     ``The level of competition in Japan now is similar to the
U.S. in 1994-95, or Europe in 1996-97. Prices are about 400
percent higher than the U.S.
     ``To put it in perspective, I won't give the name of this
large chemical company, but it consumes about 600 megawatts. If
you compare that business with a company that's just like it in
Houston, Texas, the difference would be about $250 million a year
in the cost of electricity.
     ``For such an export-led economy, that's a difficult
situation to be in, and it's contributing to the overall malaise
in the economy.''

On the likelihood of a California-style electricity crisis in
Japan:
     ``Despite exploitation of California by the utilities, METI
(Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) and others recognize it
was a problem of design, not competition'' in California.

	I talked to Lisa with ENW and told her I would pass her concern on to
	the regulatory and marketing group.  That seem to make her feel better
	anyway.  We are working with her and other customers as needed to
	help them through the Timely process for the first.  At this time we are
	not planning on extended the Timely deadline, but we will revisit that decision
	as we get closer to 11:30.  Thanks for everyones support and help.  Lynn

Lynn,

Trading gas for the first day of month is already a hectic if not absolutely crazy day.  Putting out the final posting of the fuel rates the day of trading is not acceptable.  Northern has one of the most complicated fuel matrices in the industry and expecting your customers to change those matrices the day of trading puts us in a very tough situation.  It will difficult at best to get you our nominations in a timely manner due to your decision.   Next time you decide to change fuel rates at least give us one day to implement the changes not two hours.

Subject: DJ POWER CUTS: Blackouts Lead Firms To Examine Power Supply 



18:34 GMT 14 August 2000
=DJ POWER CUTS: Blackouts Lead Firms To Examine Power Supply  By Christina
Cheddar  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--For several hours on
June 14, around 97,000 power customers in San Francisco's Bay Area lost
electricity, as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. struggled to reduce its
overburdened network by taking accounts off line.  Apple Computer Inc.
(AAPL) was one of the businesses left in the dark, along with other firms
and consumers in a five-county area, as the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp.
(PCG), rotated off blocks of 35,000 customers for 60 to 90 minutes at a time
after other attempts to reduce demand failed.  Apple considers itself
relatively lucky because it was able to keep doing business that day thanks
to a contingency plan, according to spokeswoman Lynn Fox. Whether that
back-up plan includes buying in alternative electricity or some other means
Apple wouldn't say.  What is sure is that as Silicon Valley expands through
the nation's most populous state - and California shows no sign of quickly
resolving its power problem - technology firms large and small are among
those businesses that stand to suffer financially from lost production time.
These big power consumers are spending a lot of money to back up their
regular electricity sources, industry observers said, and in some cases that
spending may be as much of a bottom-line factor as the power outages
themselves.  Unreliable power costs the U.S. economy about $50 billion a
year, said Bernie Ziemianek, of EPRI, a Palo Alto, Calif., think-tank
focused on power issues and technology. Ziemianek thinks that figure - which
considers lost productivity and the cost of equipment and products damaged
during a power interruption - could double in the next three to five years
because of the growth of Internet-related activity and electronic commerce.
Mark Mills, co-author of the Digital Power Report, a trade newsletter,
believes that cost is already higher because the economy is increasingly
dependent on reliable power. It is no longer just hospitals and military
bases that can't do without uninterruptible power; semiconductor makers,
telecommunications providers and a host of other industries cannot do
without full-time electricity.  By the end of the decade, Internet-related
activity and e-commerce could account for about 25% to 35% of the total U.S.
electric demand, said Raymond James analyst Frederick Schultz, compared with
about 8% in 1998.  "The new U.S. economy can scarcely survive the annual
power outages and interrupted service problems that have plagued the power
grid over the past few years," Schultz said.       Hot Days, Hot Economy -
And Hot Debate    Although the California power outage made headlines across
the country, rolling blackouts in the state are about as rare as a
traffic-free Los Angeles freeway. Indeed, the state has never declared a
so-called Stage 3 emergency, which occurs when the statewide power reserve
falls below 1.5% and involuntary power interruptions may begin on a wide
scale. Rolling blackouts have been more common in the East Coast and the
Midwest, which are two areas that also are susceptible to storm-related
outages.  While some industry watchers have faulted deregulation for the
struggle to meet power demand in California, others argue that hot weather
and robust economic growth are to blame. The truth probably lies somewhere
in the middle.  A year ago, California's weather was cooler than usual, but
this year the state has had a hot summer. On June 14, the day of the Bay
Area blackout, the temperature in San Francisco reached 103 degrees, a level
not seen for 135 years. That spike, coupled with overall growth in
electricity usage, pushed the power grid to its limits.  "Over a 10-year
period, this state will need 10,000 megawatts of additional energy to keep
up with the growth we are seeing now," said PG&E spokesman Greg Pruett.
Indeed, with hot summer weather, and new capacity still a long way off, the
number of Stage 2 emergencies California has declared is on the rise. In a
Stage 2 emergency, power reserves are below 5%, and many utilities begin to
contact accounts that have identified themselves as "interruptible
customers" and ask them to reduce their usage by set amounts. Those
so-called interruptible customers are typically commercial and industrial
accounts.  By early August, the California Independent System Operator had
declared nine Stage 2 alerts, said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the
nonprofit agency that manages most of the electricity flow around the state,
compared with one in 1999 and four in 1998.  During a Stage 2 alert,
interruptible customers agree to cut their consumption, when asked, in
return for lower electricity rates, and often help to stave off the need to
resort to more serious measures such as rolling blackouts. However, it can
be a double-edged sword for the commercial customer, which can face steep
fines if it fails to comply with the order. Penalties can offset the savings
the company stands to gain from the program, and that's even before
accounting for the cost of lost productivity.  Aerospace and defense giant
Boeing Co. (BA) and technology distributor Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) are two
companies operating facilities in California under the interruptible
customer program. During the first week of August, each was called upon to
reduce its power consumption. Both companies see the program as a way to act
as good members of the community while saving money.  "The manufacturing of
a rocket takes two to three years," said Walt Rice, a spokesman at Boeing's
Huntington Beach, Calif., facility. "The impact (of a Stage 2 power
reduction) is fairly outweighed by the cost savings," he said.  "We live in
a state where there is a high demand for electricity, we are doing things to
shed even a small amount of that demand," said Paul La Plante, senior vice
president of worldwide facilities for Ingram Micro.  Still, company
officials admitted compliance isn't without inconvenience. Companies need to
work closely with utilities to determine the number of power interruptions
they can tolerate, Ziemianek said, but that determination can be difficult
to make.  For example, while a semiconductor plant operator knows a mere
brownout can destroy a day's production and prepares for this event, the
operator of a commercial bakery may be unprepared for the disruption a
brownout can have on the microchips embedded in its machinery, Digital Power
Report's Mills said.  Companies such as Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) and
Qwest Communications International Inc. (QWST) are spending more money on
systems either to back up, replace or supplement the electricity supplied
from the power grid than the entire electric industry is spending by a
factor of at least five, possibly 10, said Mills. "The stakes are too high,
if you are Nasdaq, a dotcom or a fab maker," he said.       Other Power
Options    For that reason, companies are trying to be savvier about their
power usage. Earlier this year, Oracle Corp. (ORCL) considered going off the
power grid entirely by building its own power generation facility. A
spokeswoman for the Redwood Shores, Calif., software company wouldn't
provide further details of the plan's progress.  This option may seem
severe, but it's one reason why the makers of power turbines are faced with
extensive order backlogs, and it's also driving demand for uninterruptible
power supplies, such as those manufactured by companies like Emerson
Electric Co. (EMR), and for new power technologies such as fuel cells,
flywheels and microturbines - some of which are still years away from
commercial viability.  Others, like Silicon Energy Co., are developing
products to allow utilities and their customers to better manage their
electric consumption. Silicon's software allow its users to track their
real-time electricity consumption.  With this in mind, Mills suggests that
the real financial impact of power interruptions isn't the money companies
lose on these events, but the value of what companies are willing to spend
to cushion the blow of blackouts when they occur.  -By Christina Cheddar,

Folks-
Above is a link to the Governor's press release issued late yesterday on a
new bill he is working on with Senator Alpert and Assemblymember Davis. The
bill is now being identified as Senate Bill 1433 by Senator Alpert. The bill
is currently on the Assembly Floor. Senator Alpert, in the press conference
yesterday, said the bill could be amended and heard as early as TODAY!!!! I
will let you know as I hear more.

Thanks,
Delaney

	Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.  But, you have a responsibility
	to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if
	there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.

This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Three heavily Democratic counties continue to handcount
ballots that were meant to be counted by machine.

As the process continues, it has become apparent why
machines are used to count these ballots.

There have been reports of Bush ballots in the Gore
pile, counters using ballots as fans, and chads on the
floor and on the counting tables....

Cick here to watch a member of the Miami-Dade County
Canvassing Board bend, scratch, poke and press a
ballot during the manual recount...

Sometimes, a picture is worth a thousand words....

Shelley and Steve,

I am moving all ETS Blackberry devices off the Corp Invoice onto a new Account for ETS that I have set up this week

I need your Pin No to move your device, it should be a number that starts with 877

I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation 
study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.  
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the 
Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists 
and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne 
has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are 
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient 
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of 
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the 
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a 
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will 
detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.

Sally

Update:  This morning I visited with Laura Rupp to check on the status of this payment and she reported this was sent 12/21.  This afternoon I received a check from BP Canada in the amount of $5,443.08 which represents payment in full for these PPAs.  This should clear City of Duluth's A/R.

I cannot believe I am so excited about getting money I have no control over!

Just heard from Kurt -- he signed off on these a couple of weeks ago, and Sandy King advises these are set to be paid with the next run (12/23) SO, it appears we will be able to clear these invoices with no difficulty.  

Nice way to start a Monday!

Lisa, per our telecon this morning, I left a voicemail for Kurt Batenhorst (BP Canada) to determine the status of the payments for the PPAs for December 2000 through April 2001.  Kurt is in Calgary this week and will be returning to the office on Monday, the 17th.

Will update as soon as I talk to him on Monday.  The total is $5,443.08.

OUTLOOK Enron Q3 EPS 43 cents vs 34

10/11/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is expected to report next Tuesday third-quarter earnings per share of 43 cents, compared with 34 cents a year earlier, according to the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of 17 brokers. 
The integrated energy company is expected to meet near-consensus results driven by its wholesale services division, analysts said.
Montgomery Securities analyst Daniel Tulis is calculating third-quarter EPS of 42 cents, 1 cent below consensus. 
Full-year EPS stands at 1.85. 
Enron's third quarter was marked by the unexpected departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, for personal reasons, with Chairman Ken Lay reassuming the key position. 
Lay is likely to remain in the position until it is filled within 12-18 months, Tulis said. 
The company remains embroiled in arbitration proceedings in India after its 2.9 bln usd Dabhol power plant in India was closed. The plant's sole client, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), failed - and later refused - to pay bills that now total about 45 mln usd.

UK: UPDATE 1-Rothschild exits base metals, precious unaffected.
By Andy Blamey

10/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Blue-blooded banker N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd said on Thursday it would shut down its base metals trading operations except in Australia - the third base metals trader this week to announce cutbacks. 
Rothschild remains firmly committed to its precious metals activity, however, company managing director and group treasurer Geoffrey Spice told Reuters.
The company, the merchant banking arm and UK branch of the Rothschild family's financial empire, chairs the twice-daily benchmark price-setting London gold fix. 
"In light of difficult trading conditions in the base metals markets, we have concluded that our limited base metals operation is no longer viable," company Chairman Sir Evelyn de Rothschild said in a statement. 
"We've been reviewing the situation for quite some time. We've found that trading conditions (in base metals) have been difficult and opportunities have been limited," Spice said. 
Rothschild would not be taking on any new positions in base metals but would see existing positions on its books through to fruition, according to clients' wishes, he said. 
Rothschild is a category 2 (associate broker clearing) member of the London Metal Exchange (LME); the company would maintain its LME membership while existing positions run their course and would review it in due course, Spice said. 
The move to exit base metals will involve the closure of Rothschild's metals sales desk in New York and a number of redundancies in the London and New York trading, sales and support areas, the company said. 
Employees were informed of the decision on Thursday afternoon; around 20 Rothschild staff in total would be affected by the move, Spice said. 
The company's Australian base metals activities would continue as normal, however, he added. 
"Australia has a very strong franchise and will continue to operate in the base metals market," he said. 
The Rothschild move follows news this week that the Bank of Nova Scotia will scale back its base metals trading desk and that Enron Metals plans to cut around 10 percent of staff as a part of a Europe-wide job cut programme. 
Base metals traders have been struggling in recent months in the face of falling business volumes and sagging metals prices as continuing economic gloom and uncertainty after the September 11 attacks on the United States leave buyers sidelined. 
PRECIOUS METALS STRONG 
Spice stressed, however, that the company's precious metals operations would continue as normal. 
"We have a very strong position in precious metals which will not be affected in any way," he said. 
"N M Rothschild remains strongly committed to our core business in precious metals and continues to be at the forefront of spot, forward and option bullion markets and a leading member of the London Bullion Market Association," the company statement said.

INDIA: London court gives Enron India unit respite in row.

10/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of U.S. energy major Enron Corp . said on Thursday it had obtained a ruling from a London court preventing a provincial government from legally challenging international arbitration proceedings. 
Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Company, has taken a local Indian utility to the International Court of Arbitration in London for a breach of contract.
The utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, had signed a contract to buy the output from Dabhol's $2.9 billion power plant on the western coast of India. It later said it did not need all the power from the 2,184 MW plant, and that it was too expensive. 
But a local regulatory authority, the Maharashtra State Electricity Commission, said the power company's dispute with the utility fell within its ambit, and that Dabhol could not proceed with the arbitration. This sparked a round of litigation, which is now at a stage where the Bombay High Court must decide whether Dabhol can take the dispute to London. 
In order to prevent more litigation, Enron obtained an injunction from the Commercial Court in London which restrains the government of Maharashtra, which owns the utility, from also filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings. 
"Over the past few months, the government of Maharashtra and other government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations," Dabhol said in a statement received late on Thursday. "This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago." 
Government officials were not be reached for comment.

ECUADOR: Three firms accept Ecuador oil contracts at WTI-$6.97.

10/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

QUITO, Ecuador, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Anglo Energy, Enron and Rio Energy agreed to match the price of $6.97 below West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for Ecuador crude contracts for November, a Petroecuador official said Thursday. 
Petroecuador last week retendered eight three-month crude contracts, each for 12,000 barrels per day (bpd), following a price dispute with former contract holders that led Ecuador's state oil company to break the contracts.
The company awarded Coastal Petroleum two contracts on Friday at WTI minus $6.97, with a floor price for WTI at $20 per barrel, and offered other interested companies the chance to match this price for November. 
Petroecuador will set the price of Ecuador's crude for December and January. 
Anglo Energy will take two contracts while Enron and Rio Energy will take one contract each, the official said on the condition of anonymity. 
It was not immediately clear what would happen to two crude contracts sought by Glencore. Glencore had yet to respond to the offer on Thursday, the source said.

UK: Asian clean tanker freight seen falling - brokers.

10/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Asian petroleum product trades are likely to benefit from falling freight costs next week, as a raft of surplus tankers makes its way towards Singapore, tanker brokers said on Thursday. 
"There's a lot of ships ballasting down from Japan, arriving from the middle of next week onwards," said a Singapore broker. "From October 15 to 20 there will be eight to 10 ships in the area. Rates will fall further."
He said that intra-Asian freight rates had already started to slide from a spike that topped W280 at the start of the week to W260 on Thursday ($17.52 per tonne). 
He said that transpacific trade, which often serves to tighten up the intra-Asian market, was dead. 
"The only arbs that are open are gasoline to Singapore from Europe and jet going the other way," he said. "Cargill did 35,000 tonnes from Malacca to UK-Cont on the High Challenge: we're guessing jet." 
London brokers said Enron had also booked a ship, the Teekay Freighter, to shift 70,000 tonnes of gasoil from Jamnagar, India to Europe. 
Brokers said that the Mideast Gulf trade, which occasionally sucks surplus ships out of Asia, was also quiet. Glencore booked two tankers for 40,000 tonne clean cargoes from Yanbu to East Coast India at W235, down 15 points on week-ago levels. 
"Long Range trades from the Gulf are quiet," said a London broker. "Nothing's happening so it's difficult to know where rates stand, but basically it's going down." 
A panel of brokers from London's Baltic Exchange pegged the naphtha trade on 75,000 tonners from the Gulf to Japan at W189 late on Wednesday, following a fall of eight points from week-ago levels.

LOCAL
DANIA RESIDENTS POKE HOLES IN PIPELINE PLAN
David Fleshler Staff Writer

(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

A proposal to build a natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to Broward County drew harsh reviews Wednesday from an audience in Dania Beach. 
Not a single speaker spoke in favor of the project, although one or two were neutral, during a public workshop held by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the I.T. Parker Community Center.
"It is totally insane to put a high-pressure natural gas pipeline through such a densely populated area," said Susan Epps, of Oakland Park. "The loss of life and property if there would be an accident would be catastrophic." 
The commission is preparing an environmental impact statement for the project. More workshops will be held once a draft is ready. The process is expected to take several months. 
Enron Corp. of Houston proposed the pipeline as a way to meet the state's growing demand for natural gas, a relatively clean and increasingly popular fuel for power plants. Two other companies have made similar proposals. 
Enron's representatives say construction of the pipeline would do minimal damage to the coral reefs in its path. And it is an extremely safe way to transport natural gas. 
But few people in the audience saw it that way. 
Dan Clark, a member of a Broward County group that monitors the health of coral reefs, said that the company's representatives painted too rosy a picture of the project's impact on coral reefs by claiming that drilling a path under the reefs would leave them unharmed. 
"What they failed to tell you is that they're going to have to assemble the pipe across the second reef and drag it across the second reef," he said. "At a time when we're losing these habitats, we don't want to lose any more, willingly." 
Some speakers questioned the wisdom of bringing in another source of fossil fuels, however clean it may be, rather than putting more effort in conservation and renewable energy. 
"Why don't we regulate people's use of energy?" asked Judy Kuchta, of North Beach in Hollywood. "Why do people have to waste energy playing stupid video games and watching mindless TV?" 
Several speakers worried about the project's effects on John U. Lloyd State Park, a popular beachfront park under which the pipeline would run. 
"The park simply can't sustain the additional degradation of pipeline construction and operation," said Sara Case, speaking for Save Our Shoreline, a Hollywood conservation group. "The beach is one of Broward County's most important sea turtle nesting areas. Shore birds are attracted to the park. We simply find it difficult to believe that significant environmental damage is not inevitable from this monumental project."

Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, plans to cut as many as 500 jobs in Europe, or as much as 10 percent of its work force there, to reduce costs and boost profit. 
The company has 5,000 workers in Europe and plans to trim jobs by 5 percent to 10 percent. "Business continues to grow in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company, we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less," John Sherriff, chief executive of Enron Europe, said.

I have checked on the status of the 's after the move and they play a critical role in our communication plan if the Lucent phones are down.  (Big backhoes can dig ditches and accidentally cut cables as we have seen in the past.)  The 's  are outside of our current Lucent phone switch and give us
the ability to make outside calls.  

Currently 's  are located and connected correctly at the following locations:
	John Buchanan  EBN4270
	Pat Barry  EBN4279
	Tracy Minter EBN3979  

But, we need additional 's  installed at the following locations:
	Terry Kowalke  EBN3972
	Jack Howard EBN3910E
	Sherry Forbish EBN4275A

This will accommodate Gas Logistics interim phone coverage plan between moves.  Please check to determine if the cost of these additional installations were included in the regular move schedule.  If you have any questions, please advise.  We will place a ' at the reconnection site.  
Thanks for you assistance.
Donna

Just got off conference call with Wachovia to review trust arrangement particularly to ensure that this is effective in not triggering tax until time of payment rather than triggering tax at funding of trust.  We think this arrangement does that as long as the following is true:
Funds put in trust should not be paid out until 2002 to provide for "service period/vesting" requirement
Must be irrevocable i.e. funds can never come back to employer so need to be careful not to overfund

Also, to keep from being subject to ERISA, need to assume that payments are not delayed until termination.  (IF subject to ERISA, creates ugly reporting/compliance issues and discrimination testing.....)

 The issue of whether to set up a new employer i.d. to hold the trust is a question - might provide more security and protection in the event of bankruptcy but might create tax deductibility issues.  Might be better if we could set up subparts for different employers to ensure tax deductibility.  I will run by external tax counsel with utmost discretion.  

If this is to be used for non-U.S. employees, need to ensure arrangement doesn't trigger taxable event at funding due to local tax law.  May not be an issue.

Are we contemplating including any insiders?

Besides Teb, who should I get approval from to change invoice due dates of the 11th or 20th that fall on a Saturday or Sunday to a due date of Friday, based on the tariff.  Or should I simply put out a message to marketing, Teb, Fraizer to announce the planned change?  Currently we're sending invoices out with the Sat/Sun date.

Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.  All VP's will be 
reviewed at an Enron-wide PRC scheduled for early August.  Representatives at 
that Enron PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato 
and Greg Piper.  They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in 
representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.  I have provided copies of your 
accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey 
for reference during that process.  

Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be 
completed before the end of July.  I will schedule an August date with you 
for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.  

Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact 
course that is required of VP's.  I thought that the course was very good.  
All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day 
course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.  I would contact 
Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.

I understand that the return e:mail that I sent to Kim Rizzi on November 27th 
was not opened by HR.  Please note on my e:mail below that I had asked for 
clarification on Brent Price.  This was the second e:mail that I had sent to 
Kim regarding Brent with no reply back.  My first message had noted for Kim 
that Brent was left out of my list, and asked whether or not Rick Causey 
planned to supply a pre-ranking for Brent or if I needed to do so.  Can you 
clarify this for me?  Brent reports to me as the head of operations for EGM 
and to Rick Causey in his role as CAO of EGM.  

Here are the appropriate pre-rankings for grouped by level:

   Superior  Excellent Strong Satisfactory    Needs Improv.  Issues

VP's      Price  Hedstrom
      Hall

Sr. Directors Solmonson Reeves Herod Scribner

Directors  Thomas  Mills  Superty Henenberg Perez   
      Wilson   Venturatos

I have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet.  You had 
included my name, and I did not put in a preliminary rank.  Brent Price's 
name is missing.  I would put him in the Excellent category at this time.  
Let me know if you need anything else.  It is possible that I may change a 
few of the preliminary rankings as I get more information from my direct 
reports who supervise certain directors.   I will let you know.  --Sally

Mike:  Do you have time to get together on Thursday to review the budget data that you have in hand?  Assumptions regarding number of employees within business units and the timing of the sale or shut-down of certain lines of business have a direct impact on the ENW revised budget for 2002.  --Sally

Rick:  Do you feel that the revised budgets that your team has received are "baked enough" so that it makes sense for us to relook at the ENW budget in light of revised plans for the various business units?  My understanding is that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.  Which would lead me to ask whether or not the revised 2002 budgets that you have are far enough along in the process for us to use in re-evaluating the ENW budget.  
 
Let me know your thoughts on your degree of comfort with the revised budgets and who on your staff we could work with to get the necessary information to rework the ENW budget, if necessary.  Thanks.  --Sally

ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Hey Don!

How are you doing? Feeling o.k. today. It was nice meeting you! I wanted to follow up on our conversatian regarding the in house counsel that you may know. Any info. that you could send my way would be tremendous help. I realize there might be a slim chance to get into anybody but it doesn't hurt to try huh? I'm actually fasinated that you are still employed with Enron. That has to be a huge success for you right now. I wanted to fresh your memory on what I'm exactly looking for. I am looking for the person who is in charge of vending out Enron's litigation support. Who will be doing the copying of the documents that Enron has. If you could poke around for me, that would be awesome! My phone # is below so if you need to call me please do so. If you want to e-mail that is fine too. Have a great day off and thanks again for your help!

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

TORONTO, Nov. 26, 2001(Business Wire/press release) -- Hollinger Canadian
Newspapers, L.P. (TSE:HCN.UN.) announces net income including special
items for the quarter ending September 30, 2001 of $51,415,000 or
$0.28 per unit compared to $22,567,000 or $0.14 per unit for the
quarter ended September 30, 2000. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the nine months ended September 30, 2001 the net income was
$167,603,000 or $0.92 per unit compared to $75,550,000 or $0.47 per
unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income before special items and income taxes in both the third
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001 was significantly
lower than in 2000, primarily as a result of the disposition of
properties to CanWest Global Communications Corp. ("CanWest") in
November 2000, the sale of UniMedia Company in January 2001, the sale
of the majority of the Ontario properties in July 2001 as well as
lower operating results at the Partnership's remaining operations,
offset in part, by lower interest expense as a result of the
conversion of the acquisition notes to units in November of 2000 and
interest income primarily related to the CanWest debentures received
in November of 2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first nine months of 2001 special items totalled
$117,777,000 and included gains arising mainly from the sale of
UniMedia Company in January 2001 and the sale of the majority of the
remaining Ontario community newspapers in July 2001. In the first nine
months of 2000, special items totalled a loss of $1,672,000 and
principally represented severance charges. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same Store Analysis<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a same store basis, including only those newspapers which were
owned for the nine-month period in each year, total revenue was
$77,421,000 in 2001 compared to $81,982,000 in 2000, a decrease of
$4,561,000 or 5.6%. EBITDA for 2001 was $8,581,000 compared to
$10,756,000 for 2000, a decrease of $2,175,000 or 20.2%.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment and Other Income<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the nine months ending September 30, 2001, investment and
other income includes a cash dividend of $1,225,000 on 8,164,000
CanWest non-voting shares, interest on cash balances of approximately
$3,300,000, interest income of $23,958,000 accrued on the subordinated
debentures the Partnership received as partial consideration from the
sale of newspapers to CanWest in November 2000 and other interest
income of $2,272,000. This debenture interest is payable at the option
of CanWest either in cash, by the issue of additional debentures or by
the issue of CanWest shares. The total principal amount of debentures
(as adjusted, if required) is due on November 15, 2010. The principal
amount of these debentures was $239,861,000 as at December 31, 2000.
On February 28, 2001 and July 31, 2001, a CanWest subsidiary issued
additional debentures with a total principal amount of $20,983,000 to
the Partnership. These debentures represent the arrears interest owing
from November 16, 2000 to July 31, 2001 calculated at 12.125% per
annum, of which $17,473,000 relates to the current year. As a result,
the principal amount of all CanWest debentures held at September 30,
2001 is $260,844,000.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial Condition and Liquidity<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working capital consists of current assets less current
liabilities. At September 30, 2001, working capital was $28,398,000
compared to $43,473,000 at December 31, 2000. The $15,075,000
reduction in working capital results from lower cash balances on hand
at September 30, 2001 primarily due to cash distributions in excess of
cash inflows during the period.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term debt, including the current portion was $100,000 at
September 30, 2001 compared with $1,237,000 at December 31, 2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows provided by operating activities were $22,783,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 compared with cash flows
provided by operating activities of $98,981,000 in 2000. The reduction
in cash flows provided by operating activities compared to 2000
results primarily from the sales of the Unimedia and Ontario newspaper
properties and lower operating results at the Partnership's remaining
operations.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in financing activities were $375,062,000 for the
nine months ended September 2001 as compared to $107,953,000 for 2000.
The cash flows used in financing activities included cash
distributions of $374,968,000 in 2001 as compared to $107,424,000 in
2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows provided by investing activities were $340,143,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 as compared to cash flow used
in investing activities of $7,963,000 in 2000. The increase in cash
flows provided by investing activities results primarily from the
proceeds on sale of the Unimedia and Ontario papers in January and
July of 2001. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year, the Partnership has paid two special
distributions of $0.70 in March of 2001 and $1.18 in August of 2001
using the proceeds from the sale of properties during the year.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2001, the Partnership, Hollinger International Inc.
and Hollinger Inc. announced that the Partnership had constituted a
committee of independent directors to explore with Hollinger the
possibility of an offer to purchase the units of the Partnership not
held by Hollinger, being approximately 24 million units. The structure
and terms of any such offer (including the form of consideration to be
offered) have not been proposed and there can be no assurance that any
offer will be made.<BR>

Lucy,

       Here are the actual utility bills versus the cap.  Did we collect 
these overages?  Let's discuss further?  Remember these bills were paid in 
July and August.  The usage dates are much earlier.  I have the bills but I 
can get them to you if need be.

Philip

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

I don't know who/what got everything stirred up today.  It is true I have other offers, but none are new -- I've been thinking about them for several weeks and haven't made up my mind.  I'll let you know when I figure it out!

Jennifer,
I had forgotten to invite Roy, but I did tell him about the meeting, and he 
was OK w/getting the notes after the fact.  I also told him I would not 
forget to keep him in the loop and invited to any future meetings.

As for Ron Smith, I really have egg on my face.  I totally forgot about Ron 
(I was thinking only Instromet, and S-J was running with that).  I think that 
in my excitement and effort to get this meeting put together, I overlooked a 
few important details.  I will certainly do a better job next time!

Thanks for the reminder!

JY
p.s. I was unable to get w/George during the day yesterday, but I did catch 
him at about 6:35pm.  I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities 
(Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).  He gave me some good feedback, 
and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.  The only thing 
I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on 
feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do 
the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW 
felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I 
can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this 
case.  But next time, there won't be a next time - so that won't be an issue 
anyway!

Jeff,
The meeting minutes look great and that it was a very beneficial meeting for 
all parties.  Was Roy or Ron invited?  If not let's make sure that they are 
at the next meeting so we do not get any static from them.

Subject: Hires & Terminations

Sharon, Kristi, & Michelle,
I am currently involved in a task group that is reviewing processes for the 
Transaction Processing Center, SAP go live on 7/1.  The processes involve all 
aspects from hiring, transfers, position control and termination.  I wanted 
to drop a line to check with you to see if there were any current reviews 
that your group might be conducting at this time that would require updates 
or changes to the current state processing.  We want to be sure to capture 
all gaps (i.e.  specific terminology, forms, letters, contracts, etc.) are 
documented and resolved before go live.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you could provide at this time.  
Also, if you are aware of any other groups that might need to be contacted 
that have a vested interest, we will gladly give them a call.

Thanks so much,
Sylvia

Ladies and Gentlemen,

	The FBI and the Department of Justice have reviewed an Enron Org Chart current as of October 2001, and now are requesting individual Org Charts for your respective 	business units.

	They essentially are trying to understand the teams that work for/report in to each of you, and get a better feel for Enron's business and corporate staff functions.
	For the larger groups, your direct reports and key commercial and staff support should suffice. For the smaller groups, a more complete list of your team would be 	appreciated.

	At your earliest convenience, please provide me with a copy of the following Org Charts:

		1.	Enron Global Services - Stan Horton

		2.	Risk Management/Chief Risk Officer - Rick Buy

		3.	Enron Broadband Services - Jim Fallon

		4.	Accounting/Chief Accounting Officer - Rick Causey

		5.	Global Finance/Treasury - Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen

		6.	Investor Relations - Mark Koenig

paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, Aug. 10, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Europe is no longer the happy hunting ground it was for spot deal makers. With a weak Euro and rock bottom prices for regular business, there is little room for undercutting without sinking below production costs.
North American suppliers of spot hardwood tonnes have gradually disappeared from the European scene since the beginning of July. Their home market is a more lucrative place in present conditions. Canadian producers are already selling pulp at below full costs of production and suppliers from other parts of the world are coming up against the same predicament.
Eucalyptus, as one buyer in Germany put it, "doesn't really exist on the spot market any more." There is still some softwood around for those who seek spot tonnage. But the downtime which pulp mills have been forced to take, allied to the fact that there is precious little difference between the spot deals and the price for regular business, means buyers are more likely to be pestered by their regular suppliers to take their normal quota than by hawkers of spot tonnes out to do a deal.
What little Canadian NBSK that is available on the European spot market is priced at around $400/tonne. This is rather more than the Scandinavian equivalent, which has arrived on the market thanks to the over-production which June's Norscan figures revealed. Much of this pulp, which is available at some $20-30/tonne cheaper than Canadian NBSK, has found its way to Asia and the Middle East to compete for Government tenders.
The availability of spot tonnes from Scandinavian producers could frustrate regular European buyers who need no extra tonnes and would have to break contracts to take advantage of this cheaper surplus.
Reports of much stronger buying activity in Asia also explain a shift in spot pulp supply away from Europe. But this could be tempered marginally by a fall in the price of radiata pine pulp supplied to the region by Latin American producers.
The Pulpex August 2001 NBSK contract closed up $10.25 last week at $407.5 DDU net. Pulpex is not an exact mirror of the spot market but has proved a useful barometer and this rise suggests that there is at least little more downward pressure on spot prices.
Spot prices in Europe during the week ending August 10 were: NBSK $370 - 400/tonne, eucalyptus $330 -340/tonne.

Sorry for the typo in the Rushing Game Matchups.   Before you call your
commish, Brad Hoover is the Carolina RB in the mix, not his lookalike evil
twin, Fred...

See you tonight with the Passing Game Matchups.

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under "bulletins" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

In order  to improve efficiency and segregation of duties within 
International Global Products, a new Coordination team is being created in 
London to take on the Control functions currently performed within the 
Logistics team.

This will allow the Commercial Logistics team to concentrate on improving the 
bottom line results by negotiations and arrangements with outside parties. 
The Commercial Logistics team (Europe) headed by Graham Cane will now report 
to Chris Mahoney.

The Coordination function has been set up by Cindy Horn, who will be handing 
over the leadership to Becky Millerchip on following the implementation of 
SAP for Global Products. This team will handle all paperwork and 
reconciliations with regard to product movements of Global Products generated 
by the London and Helsinki offices, and the further processing of this 
information to the systems and users downstream. 

The Coordination function for Houston and Panama City will be headed by 
Michelle Bruce, with the Logistics team headed by John Harrison now reporting 
directly to John Nowlan.  Michelle will build her team during the third 
quarter.

A similar rationalisation of roles in the Far Eastern offices will be 
announced in due course.

Please join us in congratulating Graham and Becky, Michelle and John  on 
their new responsibilities, and in thanking Cindy for her hard work in making 
this happen.

2002 YEAR-END VACATION CARRYOVER GUIDELINES


I will be sending to you today hard copies of the vacation carry-over report for your business unit. Please verify the accuracy of the 40 hours carry-over and sign the bottom of the page.  Additionally, if you have employees, who for business reason, need to carry-over more than 40 hours, please do the following:

?	Place the total number of hours over the 40 hours carry-over in the column entitled "additional carry-over amount approved" 
?	Initial and provide business rationale. If there is not enough space on the report, please provide your rationale under separate cover. 
Please sign and date at the bottom of each sheet. 


Approval for carryover in excess of 40 hours will need the approval of the Creditors Committee and Executive HR. 
Please complete and return sheets to me  by January 22, 2002. The endorsed exceptions will be reviewed by the Bankruptcy Committee and Human Resources leadership from January 25-29, 2002. We hope to post and reflect all approved carry-over vacation by January 31, 2002. Please call if you have any questions. I appreciate your support in this process.

Mortgage rates are still attractive today, according to E-Loan, despite climbing from last year's lows. In fact, current rates are as low as those available for most of last year. With these low rates, you could still benefit by refinancing today. 

It's not too late to save
The Schwab Mortgage Center provided by E-Loan makes it easy to compare your rate to the current market <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/QHF8/572F/0C6E/ID/D4IQ6M>. So you can quickly find out if refinancing now makes sense for you. 

At today's rates, many homeowners find they can still reduce their monthly payments - and put a little extra cash in their pockets. 

Why wait? Find a rate that's right for you.
Visit the Schwab Mortgage Center provided by E-Loan and get an immediate quote <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/QHF8/UBLK/0C6E/ID/D4IQ6M>. Or call 1-888-924-2882 to speak directly with an E-Loan consultant.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

Thanks for your nice note.  I certainly follow your career with interest.  

I have been meaning to call to tell you how much we enjoyed getting the 
wedding picture with your Christmas card.  What a great picture - you look 
beautiful and happy.  Meagan and Amanda particularly enjoyed seeing it.  My 
best laid plans for Christmas cards became a limited vision this year - only  
managed to get them in the mail to people outside of Houston.  Maybe next 
year...

I am in your old stomping grounds this week -- London.  I will see Mo 
tomorrow night for dinner and to catch up on her life.  

See you next week!  --Sally

Ann, I am following up on the status of the research involving Section 6.4 of 
the SPA; specifically, what are the potential liabilities of Enron selecting 
persons for termination and providing those names to the Seller?  I would 
like to have this research asap because our time table is very short.  Do you 
have any information on that?  Thanks.  Michelle Cash

Subject: Fwd: GSP Benefits Required Action List


Mr. del Vecchio and Ms. Cash,

We are following up regarding the outstanding benefits issues in the GSP 
purchase.  It is very important that certain benefits matters be addressed 
and resolved before the Closing Date.

Attached is a copy of our Benefits Required Action list, which was sent to 
Dolores Lenfest, Mark Greenberg, and Mr. del Vecchio on July 21, 2000.  We 
spoke with Stuart Zisman today, who suggested we make sure that both of you 
have receive a recent copy of the list.  (Please let us know if you have any 
problems opening the WordPerfect document.  The page set-up to print should 
be 'landscape'.)

Among the outstanding issues is the amount of potential withdrawal liability 
existing in the 2 multiemployer pension plans.   These numbers should be 
requested from the multiemployer plans as soon as possible.  A concern has 
been raised as to whether requesting such information from the multiemployer 
plans will create problems with the union or plan because the union or plan 
might be given the false impression that GSP anticipates terminating these 
benefits.  We do not expect any such problems (especially if the plan is told 
that the sale is anticipated and the buyer wants to make sure of its 
potential liabilities).  A request for withdrawal liability, although not a 
daily event, is something that falls within the ordinary administration of a 
plan.   The plans should either have this amount immediately available, or be 
able to calculate this amount for you.  If you would like us to assist you 
with obtaining this information, please let us know.

We have included Dolores Lenfest as the responsible person for the majority 
of the required actions, since she had been our main contact.  If any of 
these actions have been assigned to another responsible party, please let us 
know.

Thank you.
Ann Murray

Graduate Brothers, 
      Our new cabinet is in place and now functioning with some degree of competency.  If you need to get a hold of us for any reason the contact numbers are: 
            President: Kurt Niebuhr (785) 395-0996  x 237 
            Treasurer: Chris Jackson                      x 128 
            Recording: Joey Buckley                      x 202 
            Corresponding: Nick Seglie                   x 127 
       
      Over break the cabinet traveled to Internationals in Lexington for a cabinet retreat and represented well for Chi Deutron. 
      Our newly elected scholarship chair, Jon Schlatter, just received the first annual Tim Donatell scholarship.  The scholarship was organized by a group of Tim's pledge brothers to honor him and help out an undergrad brother. 
      This semester we will not be pledging a spring class because there is no room left in the house, but we still need over twenty great guys for next fall.  So, if you know anyone who might be good for the house call or e-mail the rush chair, Jason Ingram (785) 395-0996 x 120;   knowjason@hotmail.com. 
      Other than that we are preparing for the upcoming semester and focusing on integrating this large pledge class into the house. 
Perge, 
Nick Seglie 
Corresponding Secretary

videos from FT.com, giving you a clear insight into the current
state of America's high-tech heartland.

The last video in the series, Online Advertising, examines the new
tactics being adopted by online publishers in a bid to attract
more business.  So whether you're thinking about your web
advertising strategy or trying to attract more advertisers to

Wendy is taking on the role as Requirements and Design Manager for Rates & Revenue.  All project related questions regarding the Rates & Revenue project should be directed to Andy.   

Jeanne is taking responsibility for all remaining CMS/CRS/CAS project efforts including the TW CMS/CRS implementation as well as all CMS/CRS/CAS production support related items.  Please direct all inquiries regarding these applications to Jeanne.

These individuals will be working together to complete this transition by February 1st.  Thanks for your support as we make these changes.

Dear Friend and/or Colleague,
 
A summary of the 2001 season, real-time forecasts of Columbia River runoff made weekly with the HyMet model can be viewed at the following website: 
 
<http://www.hymet.com/colnex1.htm>
 
These results show the accuracy of each forecast made at the three main sites (Grand Coulee, The Dalles and Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River) from January 1 to June 30, 2001, and also demonstrate the influence of abnormal precipitation and temperature during the forecast season on the accuracy. 
 
Precipitation in the Pacific Northwest during the 2001 forecast season was near the record historic low in this region, therefore a significant fraction of the forecast error can be explained by subsequent weather conditions.
 
Your comments are welcome.

Regards/Wendell

LETTER FROM COLLEGE

An exact replica of a letter a daughter wrote to her parents
from college

Dear Mom and Dad:

It has now been three months since I left for college. I
have been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for my
thoughtlessness in not having written before. I
will bring you up to date now, but, before you read on,
please sit down.

YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN.

OKAY! Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. The
skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of
the window of my dormitory when it caught
fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I
only get those sick headaches once a day.

Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump were
witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm,
and he was the one who called the fire department
and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and,
since I had nowhere to live because of the burned out
dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share
his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but
it's kind of cute.

He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and
are planning to be married. We haven't set the exact date
yet, but it will be before my pregnancy
begins to show.

Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are
looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will
welcome the baby and give it the love,
devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.

The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my
boyfriend has some minor infection, which prevents us from
passing our pre-marital blood tests, and I
carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with
the penicillin injections I am having daily. I know you will
welcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind and,
although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is
of a different race and religion than ours, I know your
often-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered
by the fact that his skin color is somewhat different from
ours. I am sure you will love him as I do.

His family background is good too, for I am told that his
father is an important gun-bearer in the village from which
he came.

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you
that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a
concussion or a skull fracture. I was not in the hospital, I
am not pregnant, I am not engaged. I do not have syphilis
and there is no man in my life.

However, I am getting a 'D' in History and an 'F' in Science
and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.

Yours,

Your Loving Daughter.

Johnny:

Thank you for your prompt response to my phone call this morning.  Attached 
is a resume and cover letter for your review.  If you recall from our 
conversation Friday, I was visiting with Tony Vasut about positions on your 
power trading desk as an hourly trader.  The power desk is something I have 
been interested in learning more about for several months.  When you informed 
me of the current opportunities as an hourly power trader I was extremely 
interested.  I would love to meet with you or anyone from the desk at your 
convenience to discuss the opportunities in detail.  Please feel free to call 
at X58039, or reply to this e-mail.
Thank you again for your time.

Sincerely,
Andrew Greer

     Michelle:  You have 6 seats for the Orioles-White Sox game on Monday
evening, August 14.  These are the "firm seats" that I mentioned -- along
the third baseline above the visitor's dugout.  Game time is 7:35 p.m.  I'll

Hello Karen,

As we did not have the foresight to buy you flowers, can we take you out for coffee??  As an ex-banker, I am sure you appreciate our practical choice:)

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

Thanks for letting me know about this.  I have copied Bob Hall, since he manages daily operations for EA I know that he would want to be aware of critical issues, particularly at this time.  I will also use this as an illustration with the rest of my team during a staff meeting tomorrow morning so that my direct reports who manage operations across all commodities will be aware of the potential risks created with manual wires.  --Sally

Teresa,

Pursuant to a discussion you had with Debbie Brackett last month regarding manual wires not process through SAP impacts the return of collateral a great deal.   It is very important that these manual wires be processed immediately in order for us to receive the correct feeds from SAP and calculate the correct net exposures for each counterparty.

Today, Melissa Ratnala confirmed that we made a manual payment to Reliant Energy Services on October 10th in the amount of $57MM.  Unfortunately, we were not advised of the payment and it was not reflected in the SAP feeds.  This resulted in Reliant holding $57MM collateral for an additional 12 days.  The management of cash collateral is extremely important and we need accurate information, in order to manage our daily cash position.  

Please advise of any other counterparty that manual wires were made.  

How can we resolve this issue promptly?


Thanks,

Hello Sally, 

This e-mail is to confirm the message I left for you earlier this morning.  I have attached the speaking sessions below.  Please let me know as soon as possible the session that you would be interested in conducting for the NABA Conference.  Also, two of your employees are interested in participating at the conference Mark McClure and Errol McLauglin.  You have a total of four conferences passes to utilize for your group.  Please let me know if you would like them to attend for career development purposes.  They are both willing to recruit at the conference.  NABA is expecting over 2,000 professional participants this year.  Thank you for your support for the organization.  This will be a wonderful new partnership for Enron and your organization.  Please call me if you have any questions.

13:46 02Aug2001 RSF-US Midwest power falls, storm knocks out Ill. nuke

    SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Midwest spot power prices slipped again on Thursday on cooler weather, but temperatures were set to rise again over the weekend and into early next week, although not to the high levels seen earlier this week.
    In the news, a confirmed report hit the market late in the trading day that lightning had sparked a fire in the main transformer of Exelon Nuclear's Quad Cities' Unit 2 in Cordova, Illinois, forcing the 789-megawatt (MW) unit off line.
    Exelon said the fire was quickly extinguished at 8:45 a.m. CDT, about 30 minutes after the lightning struck.
    There were no injuries and no release of radioactivity as a result of the fire.
    Meanwhile, the adjacent 789-MW Quad Cities Unit 1 continued to operate at a slightly reduced level of 96-97 percent.
    An Exelon spokesman said he believed equipment would have to be replaced, but the situation remained very uncertain while operators continued to evaluate the situation.
    He could not estimate the duration of the outage.
    Traders said the effect of the shutdown on the market would depend largely on the duration of the outage, and they speculated that a slight firming of ComEd prices during the day might have been spurred by reports of the trip.
    "If there's a crunch when these things happen, prices tend to be overamplified," one trader said.
    "Right now the perception is things have calmed down a bit from the last several days, but we're anticipating temperatures will heat up over the weekend and into next week and that brings a whole new notion of motivation for higher prices."
    ComEd said it reached an all-time peak record of 21,263 MW on Tuesday, surpassing its previous record set in July 1999.
    The company had been projecting a new record again on Wednesday, but temperatures did not reach levels expected.
    In the forwards market, prices eased slightly. "It's still pretty quiet. Gas is up so everything is ticking up a bit with that, but it's not outrageous," another trader said.
    Weather Services Corp. (WSC) forecast Midwest temperatures at 4-8 degrees F above normal Friday-Saturday, 5-10 above Sunday and 6-12 above Monday.
    The WSC 6-10 day outlook called for above-normal temperatures in the Midwest.

    In other generation news, FirstEnergy Corp.'s 1,205-MW Perry nuclear unit in North Perry, Ohio, ramped up to 96 percent of capacity by early Thursday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said in its daily plant status report.
    Early Wednesday, the unit was operating at 64 percent of capacity.
    On NYMEX, Hub natural gas, shrugging off a softer cash, moved higher at midday, lifted by some heat in Texas and the Northeast and some short covering on reports a tropical depression may be forming in the Gulf of Mexico.
    At 12:40 p.m. EDT/11:40 a.m. CDT, September was up 8.4 cents at $3.165 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).
    Physical gas prices at the Chicago city gate were pegged at $3.13-3.21, down from $3.27-3.32 on Wednesday.
    ECAR---
    In the East Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement (ECAR) region, firm peak power prices for delivery Friday, including those into Cinergy, traded in a $45.00-49.00/MWh range with most trades going through at around $46.00.

Best of the Web Today - January 14, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
'A Significant Political Opportunity'  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40691-2002Jan13.html

Quoted in today's Washington Post, an unnamed "key Democratic strategist" has this to say about the Enron fiasco: "Democrats are very excited about this because this gives us a hook to bring this guy [President Bush] some accountability, plus there's no way it's not going to be a distraction for them. Privately, Democrats are almost unanimous in seeing this as a significant political opportunity. But we don't want to blow it."

Pardon us for spoiling the party, but there is a war on. It's not the most opportune of times to distract the president with a phony political scandal. Of course it's another matter if investigations turn up evidence of genuine wrongdoing by government officials, but if this strategist is to be believed, Democrats are happy to proceed in the absence of any such evidence.

And what exactly is the Bush administration alleged to have done? Here's Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, on yesterday's " Meet the Press  http://msnbc.com/news/686453.asp ": "If there was any, any involvement because of the incredible help the Bush campaign got from Enron here, it will be--I don't know that there has been--but it will be devastating." But on "Fox News Sunday," Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut echoed Rep. Henry Waxman, who, as we  noted Friday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001718 , said it was a scandal that the administration refused to give Enron special treatment. Fox doesn't have a transcript on its Web site, so here's a  CNN report  http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/01/13/enron/index.html :

*** QUOTE ***

[Treasury Secretary Paul] O'Neill, a guest on "Fox News Sunday," defended the government's decision not to intervene as Enron's stock price collapsed. Lieberman called O'Neill's comments "outrageous" and promised an aggressive investigation of Enron's collapse.

*** END QUOTE ***

Before the Democrats start throwing around accusations, shouldn't they at least agree on what would constitute a scandal?

The President and the Pretzel  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41179-2002Jan14.html

Here's an early nominee for  bottom news story  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001644#bottom  of 2002: President Bush was watching the Miami-Baltimore playoff game yesterday when, as Press Secretary Ari Fleischer explains, "he was eating a pretzel, and he said it felt like it did not go down right. He fainted. He woke up what he believes were a few seconds later." He scraped his cheek when he fell. The White House physician checked him out, and he's fine. The Dolphins, on the other hand, choked, losing to the Ravens 20-3.

Picking Up the Pieces  http://www.observer.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1501,631972,00.html

"American special forces searching the Tora Bora cave complex in eastern Afghanistan are collecting dismembered fingers and human organ tissue in an attempt to establish whether Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were killed during last year's massive assault on the caves," reports London's Observer. The paper quotes an unnamed "intelligence source" as saying: "Just before the complex fell, I got a call from a friend involved in the operation. He told me: 'We really think we've got him. It's only a matter of time.' All the information we had at that time suggests he must be dead."

The paper's sources say their "most likely hypothesis" is that Osama has met Allah. The  Christian Science Monitor  http://csmonitor.com/2002/0114/p1s2-wosc.html , however, says that Afghan intelligence officials think he's in Pakistan.

How Omar Got Away  http://www.msnbc.com/news/686895.asp

Newsweek interviews Qari Saheb, who served as Mullah Mohammad Omar's personal driver, who explains how the top Talib escaped:

*** QUOTE ***

Saheb was with Omar at his compound in Kandahar last Oct. 7 when the first American bombs began to fall. According to Saheb, Omar initially spurned advisers who begged him to flee to safety. "Even if Bush shows up at my door, I will not leave," said Omar. His advisers told him that the Americans would use chemical weapons. Omar brandished a gas mask, but the aides warned him that the masks were good only for an hour. Knowing that the Americans would target his SUV, aides ushered Omar into a rickshaw. Pulled into the center of town, Omar shifted to a mud-covered truck and disappeared. He spent the next several days moving from house to house, sleeping in basements.

*** END QUOTE ***

Agence France-Presse  http://www.hindustantimes.com/nonfram/140102/dlame31.asp  reports that "influential Pashtuns," including members of the interim Afghan government, are helping Omar evade arrest.

Osama's Unfunniest Home Videos--I  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1758000/1758422.stm

A gun-toting toddler is among the stars of a new al Qaeda video obtained in Afghanistan and aired by the  Australian Broadcasting Corp.  http://abc.net.au/ra/newstories/RANewsStories_457534.htm  The BBC describes the scene:

*** QUOTE ***

One sequence shows a small boy--aged about two--holding a gun. A man's voice asks him in Arabic why he is carrying a gun. Is it to kill infidels, the voice inquires.

*** END QUOTE ***

The video also shows "fighters storming a building and taking hostages, barking commands at them in English and shooting one captive dead" and "an apparent assassination attack on a motorcade."

Osama's Unfunniest Home Videos--II  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34200-2002Jan11.html

The Washington Post has details of what we assume was another tape, released by the Singapore government in the wake of the recent terror bust there:

*** QUOTE ***

The tape . . . features a man describing how explosives could be carried on a bicycle without arousing suspicion. The man--identified as Hashim bin Abas, 40, a "service engineer"--was among 15 suspected Islamic militants taken into custody in Singapore last month. . . .

According to the Singapore ministry [of home affairs], the alleged terrorist cell had two plans "ready for activation." One apparently involved blowing up the shuttle bus that carries U.S. military personnel between a naval base used by visiting warships and a train station, a scenario suggested in the videotape, which appears to have been made for reconnaissance purposes.

The tape depicts the station from various angles, then focuses on a bicycle bay located beneath the north end of the station and train tracks. Bicycles are shown with cargo boxes mounted in the back.

*** END QUOTE ***

The  Straits Times  http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,1870,95812,00.html  reports that the Muslim Student Society at the National University of Singapore is applauding the arrests. "It is a very sad state of affairs that even Singapore is not free of the global terror network that is seeding chaos throughout the world," Mohamed Nawab Mohamed Osman, the group's head, tells the paper.

Radio Silence  http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/8661.htm

Abdallah Higazy, a 30-year-old Egyptian man, has been charged with perjury in an odd case that could mean nothing--or a great deal. According to authorities, Higazy, a computer-science student at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, checked into the Millenium [sic] Hilton, a luxury hotel across the street from the World Trade Center, Aug. 27 and said he planned to stay until Sept. 25. Reports the New York Post:

*** QUOTE ***

On Sept. 11, he was in the hotel room and immediately evacuated without his belongings after the attacks. . . . When hotel security eventually began clearing the rooms of personal belongings in October, an employee opened the safe in Higazy's room and found [a] pilot-to-pilot radio, a Koran, and a medallion.

The radio can be used by pilots in the air to communicate with each other or someone on the ground could use it to talk to pilots in flight. It could also be used to monitor pilots' conversations from the ground.

Higazy tried to retrieve his things in December, when FBI agents appeared and asked him about the radio. Although he admitted having some knowledge of communications equipment from being in the Egyptian Air Corps branch of that nation's army, the suspect denied the radio was his and said he'd never seen it before, authorities charge.

The Queen's Flight  http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,631967,00.html

Remember Abu Qatada, the  terrorist welfare queen  Brits%20lose%20track%20of%20terrorist%20welfare%20queen%20(S.E.%20Brenner):%20http://opinionjournal.com/best/queen  known as Osama bin Laden's "Egyptian ambassador" who lost his bid to collect &pound;213 in benefits from the British government? British Police finally got around to raiding his home last week, and found he was gone.

Our Friends the Saudis  http://www.menewsline.com/stories/2002/january/01_14_2.html

The Middle East Newsline reports that "Saudi Arabia appears to be signalling to Iraq that it is prepared for a reconciliation."

Make It a Triple  http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=13012002-102158-9032r

UPI reports that "conviction is growing in diplomatic circles where attention must be paid to such developments that the world is witnessing the emergence of a new Triple Alliance in Eurasia"--between India, Israel and Turkey.  You heard it here first.  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/tvaradarajan/?id=95001172

To Protect the Guilty  http://headlines.sify.com/476news2.html

Tehreek-i-Jafria Pakistan, an extremist political party banned by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, is changing its name to Millat-e-Jafria Pakistan, Agence France-Presse reports.

'The Taliban Wing'  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64452-2002Jan4.html

A recent Washington Post article describes how Sayed Abdullah was brutalized by the Taliban, who falsely suspected he was Christian because he had two Bibles--one in English and one in the Dari language--in his personal library:

*** QUOTE ***

Several guards came in and forced Sayed face down on the table. They tied his hands and feet to its legs. Then they beat him with sticks and heavy plastic ropes, punching, pounding, whipping. Sayed says he endured two or three hours of it before he passed out. . . .

The Taliban guards again tied him on the table. This time, they poured water on his feet, then wound electrical wires around both of his big toes. The wires were attached to an old Soviet military field telephone. The guards turned the telephone's crank, sending a searing electrical current into Sayed's feet. It went on for more than an hour. He felt as if some powerful force was lifting him high off the table, then slamming him down again, over and over.

*** END QUOTE ***

There's more, but this gives a flavor of Abdullah's five-month ordeal. In Saturday's New York Times (link requires registration), columnist  Bill Keller  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/12/opinion/12KELL.html  blasts Sens. Phil Gramm, Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond, who, he says, "have in common the fact that they harnessed their collective century of seniority to the Taliban wing of the American right." You know, the guys who torture people they suspect of being Christians.

Yasser, That's the Ticket  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/jtaranto/?id=95001721

We got such an overwhelming number of responses to  Friday's invitation  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001718#explain  to explain the Palestinian arms shipment that we had to put them in a separate article. Click on the headline of this item to read it.

High Bias  http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0112/18/asb.00.html

Andrew Sullivan  http://andrewsullivan.com/  has been doing a brilliant job rebutting liberal media folks who pooh-pooh Bernard Goldberg's best-selling book, " Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News  http://www.bennettandcurran.com/cgi-bin/Shopper.exe?preadd=action&key=0895261901 ." We particularly like this exchange, which Sullivan found in the Dec. 18 transcript of CNN's "Newsnight With Aaron Brown":

*** QUOTE ***

Brown: Some conservatives jumped on [John] Walker, saying he is a product of cultural liberalism--the California kind--helping to turn an impressionable kid against his own country.

Joining us from Salinas, California, one of those conservatives, Shelby Steele of the Hoover Institution. Mr. Steele wrote a provocative article the other day in  The Wall Street Journal  http://opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001578 --a column in the Journal.

And here in New York, a columnist who thinks Mr. Steele is making an awfully broad generalization. Richard Cohen of the Washington Post. It's nice to have both of you here. Mr. Steele.

Steele: First of all, let me interrupt you just a minute.

Brown: OK.

Steele: Is Richard Cohen a liberal?

Brown: Yeah, Richard Cohen's a liberal. I think he would say that, wouldn't he? . . .

Cohen: On this issue.

Brown: On this issue. OK. Everyone is now branded, I guess.

Steele: OK. Great.

Brown: Now let me try . . .

Steele: If I'm going to be, everybody is going to be.

*** END QUOTE ***

Of course no one suggests Brown is deliberately being unfair, but this does seem to be an indisputable example of the kind of unthinking bias about which Goldberg writes.

Let It Slide?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40795-2002Jan13.html

Speaking of the Marin mujahid, the Washington Post has another long profile of him that adds even more details about his liberal upbringing. A few tidbits: When the Lindhs (Walker's father's name) lived in ultraliberal Takoma Park, Md., before moving to Marin County, Calif., Walker's mother became "something of a local activist. Neighbors recall her waging a zealous campaign to have a metal slide at a local playground removed, saying it was too dangerous for children." Yemen, apparently, was not too dangerous for children.

In her activism, Walker's mother shamefully exploited her young daughter:

*** QUOTE ***

Marilyn Walker took their 9-year-old daughter, Naomi, to a small local demonstration denouncing U.S. bombing raids over Iraq. The Marin Independent Journal ran a photo of the girl standing amid a few dozen protesters waving signs at passing traffic that read, "Don't Kill Iraqi Kids."

*** END QUOTE ***

Our favorite detail from the story, though, is its description of Walker's high school, which "had a rare teaching philosophy: It held no classes."

Stupidity Watch  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/12/opinion/L12TERR.html
 
In a letter to the editor of the New York Times (link requires registration), one John E. Colbert of Chicago opines: "In searching for the next targets, the United States should consider other terrorists closer to home: thousands of deaths occur each year from drunken driving, gun violence and lack of health care--to name just a few culprits that terrorize and kill Americans." Yeah, John, let's drop a few bombs on lack of health care.

Wobegon in Albany  http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyKey=74614

We can't help but admire the cruelty of the Albany (N.Y.) Times Union's editors, who printed a letter from one Charles Heinze that concludes as follows:

*** QUOTE ***

If we are looking for a place to start, let's start with what the average hourly pay is in America and see to it that this is the minimum wage for all full-time employees.

And before you say it can't be done, look at what welfare, and other public assistance including health care and having the thousands of not-for-profits cost us each year.

*** END QUOTE ***

A tip of the hat to whoever wrote the headline: "All Should Be Paid at Least the Average U.S. Salary." That "at least" is a stroke of genius.

Then and Mao  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/13/wmao13.xml

London's Daily Telegraph reports on a "model Chinese village devoted to Maoist ideals":

*** QUOTE ***

Hoardings urge workers to "Put Mao Tse-tung thought in command of everything" and a deafening public address system regularly broadcasts rousing communist anthems. . . . Apartments come in only two sizes. Residents are bound by strict rules. The approval of a Communist Party committee is required for all marriages. A mass wedding is held once a year on New Year's Day. After childbirth women are sterilised. Wrongdoers are paraded through the village with their heads shaved. The village has acquired cult status among those who still pine for the certainties of the Mao era.

*** END QUOTE ***

Alas, it's being razed to make way for a business park designed to attract foreign investors.

The Son Also Sets
Several readers wrote to inquire about our  Friday item  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001718#nimitz  on the curious death notice for Rear Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and his wife. No, this wasn't the Adm. Chester Nimitz who led the Pacific fleet during World War II; he died in 1966. It was his son. You can read the  U.S. Navy  http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-4.htm  biography of Nimitz Sr. or visit the  Nimitz Museum  http://www.nimitz-museum.org/nimitz_museum.asp  in Fredericksburg, Texas. And here's the  New York Times obit  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/08/obituaries/08NIMI.html  of Nimitz Jr. (link requires registration). Our Friday item referred not to it but to a paid death notice.

Still Cold in Antarctica  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40974-2002Jan13.html

If you live in Antarctica, you've probably been waiting hopefully for years for "global warming" to kick in. Sorry, it's still cold. In fact, if you think it's gotten colder, you're not crazy. "Scientists working in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of east Antarctica have found temperatures dropping at a rate of 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit per decade since 1986, and have observed similar downward trends across the continent since 1978."

"I'd be very careful with this," Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist for  Environmental Defense  http://environmentaldefense.org/ , tells the Washington Post. "My general view has been that there's simply not enough data to make a broad statement about all of Antarctica." But we can make broad statements about the whole world?

Next headline to watch for: "Homeless Antarcticans Hit Hardest by Cooling Trend."

A Drink You Can Eat  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20020111/od/brew_dc_2.html

Reuters reports a South Korean brewer has come up with "chewable liquor"--"a gelatin form of its popular Paeksaejoo rice wine." This is supposed to be an innovation, but haven't the folks at Reuters heard of  Jell-O shots  http://www.outofthefryingpan.com/recipes/jello.shots.shtml ?

Our Ever-Expanding Rights  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/49699_judo07.shtml

Last month the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported on one of the silliest lawsuits we've ever heard of. Fourteen-year-old judo champion Leilani Akiyama went to court, claiming that the practice of bowing before a judo match violated her rights:

*** QUOTE ***

Bowing in a private club is one thing, but the practice should not be mandatory in a public facility for a tournament, said Akiyama's attorney, Mark Fleming.

Bowing "takes away critical thinking," said John Holm, Akiyama's stepfather and judo instructor. "You think you're giving respect, but it's really a submissive act."

Holm, who teaches 35 students at his judo club in Renton, says the bowing largely stems from customs of Shinto, an ancient religion indigenous to Japan. Shinto is based on custom, reverence for ancestral traditions, and living and acting according to the guidance of the gods.

Akiyama's mother, Mariko, a native of Japan, is Buddhist and doesn't want her children to be forced to practice Shinto rituals, Holm said.

He also said some Muslim and Christian students in his class have the skills and would like to compete in regional and national competitions but will not because it offends their beliefs.

"Bowing is a prayer act, and Muslims can only pray to Allah," Holm said. "It's just unfair."

*** END QUOTE ***

Judge Robert Lasnik should take a bow; last week, in a show of good sense, he ruled against Akiyama.

Pg 10 - Commodity Logic Interfaces listed are not complete - for example 
Global Databases

   Pg 12 - DCAF II Project.  We talked briefly about this before.  Why is 
this project on a priority list if Commodity Logic will deliver the same 
functionality?

Well hello again JLH-OBRs 

I have been inspired to put this OBR questionnaire on my computer and now am emailing to you to fill out and return to me. 

I am sending it as a Word document.  I can also save as WordPerfect or Unicode, if you need that.  Just let me know. 

Many thanks, Tami Grubb

   1. Introduction

   So, who the heck is LoneStarMusic.com? Well, as it says
   on our home page, we're the "True Sound of Texas." Of
   course, one man's true might be another man's trouble.

   So, what do we think true some Texan sounds are? Hmmm . . .
   acoustic guitars. Steel guitars. Townes Van Zandt's blues.
   Kelly Willis' voice. The Brothers Robison and the Sisters
   Damnation. Electric lounges, armadillos, and Do-Wacka-Do.
   Texas tornados. Broken spokes. Pat Green, Gruene Hall,
   and Lubbock (on everything). Lucky Dogs, Lost Gonzos,
   and lots and lots of Gourds.

   Whatever Willie Nelson says it is.

   2. Mission Statement

   LoneStarMusic.com wants to provide an outlet for independent,
   roots-aware Texas musicians. (As for what those roots are,
   please reference previous section). Texas has produced a
   striking amount of great, original music, and only a corporate
   behemoth can cover all of that real estate. I think we're doing
   our part, though, attempting to represent smaller artists - like
   ourselves - who are trying to get a handle on the many
   elemental influences that tug on you when you live in Texas.
   That's why we're not standing still. LoneStarMusic.com wants
   to become a full resource for Texas music. We want to provide
   information, sounds, graphics, books, and anything else that
   might help us musically navigate the ought-oughts. The future
   will include an expanded version of what Texas music is and
   who it has influenced. For now, please honor the words of
   Bob Wills ... and stay a little longer.

   6. Interview With A Craftsman - Guy Clark
      Introduction by Sunny Sweeney

   Born and raised in West Texas, Guy Clark has always stayed
   true to his Lone Star roots when it comes to songwriting.
   In this rare interview, Chad Raney, President of Lonestarmusic.com,
   gets the chance to chat with the Godfather of Texas Songwriting.
   Clark talks about his personal inspirations and shares his
   secrets to writing songs. Everyone who is anyone in Texas music
   today has been inspired in some way by this writing genius and
   musical trendsetter. Clark talks about his friendships with
   Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle and Verlon Thompson
   and reveals how his wife's brutal honesty has helped him write
   many of his amazing songs.

   7. Artist of the Month - The Groobees

   The Groobees are a Texas music band in just about every sense of
   the term as well as the words within it. First of all, they are
   one of those musical units that is genuinely a band. One can hear
   the interplay and feel the unity in the melodies and grooves they
   create together. When it comes to being musical, The Groobees not
   only offer a vast range of instrumental accents, lacing accordion,
   mandolin, and banjo over guitars(both electric and acoustic),
   keyboards, bass, and drums, but create songs that carry stories,
   imagery, emotions, and meaning in the lyrics along with giving
   each player the room to shine. And while they may not sing about
   such overworked Lone Star State subjects as beer, dancehalls, and
   two-stepping, The Groobees do reflect the breadth and depth of the
   music found in Texas, flavoring their songs with elements of rock,
   country, folk, pop, blues, and more. And getting back to just how
   much The Groobees are a genuine band, that fact is also revealed
   in how all that they do comes out sounding like nobody else but
   The Groobees.

Sally,

I thought you may be interested in seeing this as well.  We'll make sure you are kept in the loop also.  Meredith and Wanda have been the primary drivers behind the mid-office issues.

Subject:	Internal Control Scorecard

Wes,

Per Wade's request, attached is the latest EES internal control scorecard. This scorecard represents a compilation of the "highest risk" audit issues identified by Andersen and is the tool we use to track progress on resolving these issues. We also share the scorecard with Rick Causey and the EES Internal Control Committee on a regular basis (about every other month).

I will continue to keep Wade informed on the progress of these issues as most of the issues relate to the risk areas transferred to Wholesale. Also, I will copy you on all future scorecards. 

Please let me know if you need to talk about this further.

Thanks,
Misty

FYI - this is out there as a possible reason why Americas VaR did not come down to within limits as we expected.
In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

It looks like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-check?
Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why is system showing he is long?)

Karen- please circulate to all RAC worldwide. Tx Rick


It is with great sorrow that I must announce the passing of Andy Knight, 
manager in the Market Risk Group. Andy succumbed to cancer on Feb. 22, 2001 
and will have funeral services in Florida. There may be a memorial service 
here in Houston arranged through his church but details have not been 
announced. Please contact Veronica Valdez for details.

Andy was with RAC and Enron only briefly before being diagnosed, but made a 
real impact especially on those that worked closely with him. Andy had  a 
warm and personable style, which along with his technical capability, made 
him a real asset to the group. He will be missed.

Can you call Michelle or Lizzette and discuss what it is that Capstone will be providing us by way of consulting or other services.

Brent,

I agree with your assessment.  My one concern is their statement about intellectual property, as we generally are pretty tough about ownership of IP -- although I believe we can draft around that.

Either I or Lizzette Palmer can assist in the drafting of this arrangement.

Michelle,
I think what Gary really needs is a consulting agreement with a confidentiality clause.  Is this something you could draft for Gary?  If it is I will have Gary call you to discuss what it is that this group will provide Enron.
Thanks,
Brent

Brent,

please send a C.A. template to Riaz Siddiqi, Pres and CEO at Capstone Global Energy LLC. His email address is rsiddiqi@capstoneenergy.com.

We need the CA to cover a few things.  We plan to work together to offer corporate risk management solutions focused around weather.  We've targeted 3 customers to start on:  DTE, Connectiv, and First Energy.

The CA needs to address 3 things (we think):
1. the concept of working together to create these solutions
2. the specific clients
3. ideas we come up with

I assume "protected ideas" would need to be documented and stamped "confidential".

I know this is a pain - they want it and as a consulting company, intellectual property is all they really have.  And we know how you hate to start with someone else's CA... but we can get theirs if you'd like.

Gary

weather to me relatively unimportant.  yes, it will leave us with 30 bcf or 
so less in storage than if we had mild weather.  i think it is masking a 
major demand problem.  think what the aga numbers would be with moderate 
weather.  when we get into injections, i think we'll see a big push down.  
spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short.  customer buying still 
strong.  thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer, we haven't moved 
down.  however i think when the picture becomes clearer (i.e.-when we start 
beating last year's injections by 20 bcf a week), trade will get short.  
customers very unsophistocated.  the story they keep telling us is we're 
coming out 400 bcf less than last year, thus the summer has to be strong.  
when we start inj, customers will start seeing other side of story.  pira 
finally came out this week and said stop buying.  to me, the mrkt just a 
timing issue.  i want to be short before the rest of the idiots get short.  i 
continue buying m,f puts.  projecting k to settle 450 and m 400.

this strength cud persist awhile-is a little bullish ngas demand since we now
above parity in some places. shit theres so many things shaking my faith on 
the
short bias of this thing. weather hot /west cold est, hydo, califronia,mkt
talking new engl shortages.oil demand cont to show stellar y on y and curve
recoveriung, opec hawkish stance for px support.
  i think we close the y on y gap still significantly but im starting to
question how when,how much and how long prices come off in apr-jun?
thanks god i can trade oil cuz i have made anything in ngas to speak of. short
term still sort of neutral ngas-beleive we range bound. u prob know this but
hearing texas rr data coming out pretty bearish prodcution-good news .
regards

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

I asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be 
good for to consider hiring.  Here is her response.  Tony Vasut had called 
her and asked for this list as well.  Do you have him keyed in on our blitz 
effort for hiring of risk personnel?  Or is he working on some other 
initiative?  I have not reviewed the names nor Shona's comments in detail 
yet, but I wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts.  --Sally

Subject: People to consider recruiting

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to Enron.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Admin assistants

Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative 
assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for 
PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in 
Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not 
worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked 
to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC 
number).

Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave 
PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on 
how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).

All,

Please let Ron or myself know if you encounter any problems.

I have had my head buried in budgets and am just now coming up for air!  Congratulations on your new role.  With your most recent experience in Investor Relations, I know that you will do a great job in communicating with Enron's Board.  Best of luck in your new role.  --Sally

Subject:	Enron Board Elects New Corporate Secretary

I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

 on industry standards for bandwidth trading. 

 Set up by CompTel, a Washington, D.C., trade association that represents the 
competitive telecommunications
 industry, the meeting will initiate discussion among companies that are or 
probably will be active in a nascent
 bandwidth trading market that could be worth billions or trillions of 
dollars a year.

 Bandwidth is the capacity to move data over telecommunications networks. 

 Russell Frisby Jr., president of CompTel, told Dow Jones Newswires that the 
trade group's members asked it to
 get involved in the discussion of bandwidth trading. 

 The fact that CompTel is involved in discussion on bandwidth trading shows 
that people are taking the idea
 seriously, said Steven Kamman, a telecommunications analyst with CIBC World 
Markets. 

 "This year bandwidth trading will move from a theory to practice," he said. 

 Before that can happen, the industry needs to set ground rules for trading, 
and that will be a major topic of
 discussion at the meeting. 

 It comes as no surprise that Enron Corp. (ENE) will be at the meeting. For 
nearly a year, the company has been
 promoting the idea of setting up a liquid market for trading bandwidth under 
standard terms and conditions. 

 Tom Gros, vice president of global bandwidth trading for Enron, has two 
items he thinks should be at the top of
 the meeting's agenda. 

 The first is establishing an industry organization to set the standard terms 
and conditions for trading bandwidth as
 a commodity. The second is setting a North American benchmark for trading. 

 The bandwidth trading organization, or BTO, should consist of companies 
"with actual financial risk" in
 bandwidth trading, Gros said. That means the group would consist mainly of 
major telecommunications carriers,
 the bandwidth producers. 

 But others also have financial risk in bandwidth, he said, including some 
major Wall Street players and bandwidth
 consumers. 

 Gros said some Wall Street players have already begun trading bandwidth, but 
he wouldn't identify them. A
 source with a Wall Street investment bank, who didn't want to be identified, 
said Gros's claim was a stretch. 

 Banks with trading operations are consumers, using telecommunications 
bandwidth to move stock market and
 commodity trading data internationally among offices, he said. But they 
aren't actively trading bandwidth as they
 do established commodities. 

 Major consumers of bandwidth would include large Internet service providers, 
or ISPs. Gros said they should
 also be included in the BTO. 

 Before bandwidth can be quickly and easily traded domestically, the market 
needs a North American benchmark
 that sets technical specifications, Gros said. 

 In domestic crude oil trading, the benchmark is West Texas Intermediate, 
which must meet standards for
 American Petroleum Institute specific gravity and for sulfur content. 

 In the bandwidth market, standards would be set for quality-of-service 
issues like errored seconds, severely
 errored seconds and unavailable seconds, Gros said. Those standards would 
cover corruption of data
 transmitted over bandwidth as well as the availability of bandwidth. 

 Enron has suggested that the benchmark cover the route between New York and 
Los Angeles, which ranks
 among the routes with the most data traffic in North America. 

 Agreeing on standards will be the toughest job to accomplish at the meeting, 
said Ken Epps, senior vice
 president for strategic marketing for Williams Communications Group (WCG), 
which will also be represented at
 the meeting. 

 The technical standards for bandwidth trading can't be set so high that they 
limit the number of companies that
 will trade, Epps said. If the standards limit liquidity, the market won't 
develop. 

 "Everybody needs to walk away feeling that it's a standard they can live 
with, that they can build their business
 around," Epps said. 

 That goal can be met - it's just a question of how long it will take, he 
said. "I don't expect it will be settled at the
 first meeting of the CompTel group, but it will be the kickoff." 

 Williams plans to keep those discussion going next month at its own "carrier 
forum" to discuss bandwidth trading
 standards, Epps said. 

 About a year ago, when Enron first proposed trading bandwidth as a 
commodity, Williams officials were quoted
 as being skeptical about the idea. 

 But last month, the company announced it would take a leading role in 
developing a market for trading
 bandwidth. The Williams carrier meeting shows that the company is now 
serious about bandwidth trading. 

 Williams is inviting "the real players, the MCI WorldComs (WCOM), the Qwests 
(Q), the AT&Ts (T)," Epps
 said. "It's about people who have the assets and how we use these to 
advantage the marketplace, how we build
 a good powerful market model." 

 CompTel's Frisby, Enron's Gros and Williams's Epps wouldn't discuss which 
other companies were attending the
 meeting in Washington. But Dow Jones Newswires was able to obtain a list of 
attendees. 

 Among the invitees are companies with experience trading energy commodities 
- Dynegy Inc. (DYN); El Paso
 Energy Corp. (EPG); Columbia Transmission Communications, a unit of Columbia 
Energy Group (CG); and
 Koch Industries, which has investments in energy and telecommunications. 

 A surprise on the list is MCI WorldCom. Some industry sources have said the 
company opposes the idea of
 bandwidth trading under standard terms and conditions. 

 An industry analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said MCI WorldCom's 
participation in the meeting is
 indicative of changing attitudes in the telecom carrier industry about 
bandwidth trading. 

 Retail marketing groups within telecommunications carrier companies don't 
like the idea of a liquid bandwidth
 trading market, the analyst said. 

 Such a market could turn retail customers into wholesale customers. For 
example, a retail customer like an ISP
 could go to a liquid bandwidth market and buy at wholesale prices, he said. 

 Also on the attendee list are telecom carriers Teleglobe (TGO) and Global 
Crossing Ltd. (GBLX); NTT
 America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.; 
and Progress Telecom, a unit
 of the electric utility Florida Progress Corp. (FPC). 

 Also on the list is recent IPO Universal Access Inc. (UAXS), a company that 
matches carriers that have excess
 capacity with carriers that need extra capacity. 

 LighTrade, a start-up company setting up pooling points to allow bandwidth 
trading, was also invited. 

 Commodity traders are represented by Sakura Dellscher, Amerex, Prebon 
Yamane, AIG Telecom and the New
 York Mercantile Exchange. 

 Two consulting companies, Andersen Consulting and PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
were also invited.

Good Morning!

I wanted to let each of you know that I had no problem collecting sufficient 
performance data to present you to the Corporate PRC on Wednesday.  After the 
meeting I expect the results will be released to each of your PRC 
Supervisors.  You should expect them to complete your performance evaluation 
and schedule a meeting with you to discuss it.  If they do not, it is up to 
you to make the first move and ask to schedule the meeting.

Again, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet each of you and learn a bit of what 
you do.  I look forward learning even more.

Best Regards.

Gary,

Except for this week, it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42C1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control.

1. Federal Appropriations For FY2002 R&D Up 13%
   -New Released AAAS Report Indicates

2. OMB Issues Information Quality Guidelines to Agencies
   -Higher Standard of Information Now Expected

3. State of Technology in Maryland to be Held in Annapolis 
   -Focus on Technology-Based Entrepreneurship

4. National Institute Of Biomedical Imaging And Bioengineering Sees Large Increase
   -NIBIB Institute's Budget Boosted from $2 Million to $112 Million

5. President Signs Brownfields Legislation
   -FY03 Budget Shows Administration Commitment for Next Fiscal Years


*****************************
FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR FY2002 R&D UP 13%

In FY 2002, research and development was funded at its largest dollar amount in U.S. history and the largest percentage increase in nearly 20 years, according to a recently released AAAS report.  Health, defense and counter-terrorism related research show the biggest gains.

For more information, see:  http://xserver.aaas.org/news/fedsupport.html

OMB ISSUES INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS TO AGENCIES
The Office of Management and Budget has issued guidelines to federal agencies to add information quality standards to the procedural requirements agencies must meet with regard to their disseminated information.  The agencies can be sued if information agencies disseminate or use to develop regulations, fails to meet OMB's standards.
At least 50 federal offices are covered by OMB's guidelines, including: the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House, the Department of Defense, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

For more information, contact Kathryn Holmes at holmesk@asme.org. 


STATE OF TECHNOLOGY IN MARYLAND TO BE HELD IN ANNAPOLIS

ASME will join with the Technology Council of Maryland in co-sponsoring an annual gathering of Maryland lawmakers and industry leaders to discuss technology-based economic development.  This year's program will feature technology-based entrepreneurship.  Hear about challenges, accomplishments and opportunities from successful Maryland technology start-ups as well as examine how schools and universities are preparing future engineering, science and technology entrepreneurs. 

The summit will be held in Annapolis on February 4.  For program and registration details, go to http://www.asme.org/gric/
If you have additional questions, please contact Reese Meisinger at meisingerr@asme.org.


NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING SEES FUNDING INCREASE

Congress increased the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)'s budget from its $2 million start-up funding in FY2001 to $40 million for FY2002, plus an additional $72 million in existing imaging and biomedical funding transferred to NIBIB from other national health institutes.  In report language, a nine-member extramural task force was called for to review bioengineering and imaging projects throughout the National Institutes of Health.  

For more information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.


PRESIDENT SIGNS BROWNFIELDS LEGISLATION

Last week, President Bush signed legislation aimed at boosting clean up of brownfields, abandoned or underutilized industrial or commercial properties.  Redevelopment of these properties is hindered by possible environmental contamination and potential liability.  The bill provides liability protection for contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, and innocent landowners and authorizes increased funding for state and local programs that assess and clean up brownfields.  The legislation had bipartisan support.

The President also announced that his FY 03 budget will double the funds available through the EPA for FY02, to help states and communities around the country clean up and revitalize these sites.   Urban redevelopment and brownfields cleanup also will be funded at a level of $25 million through the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Dear Subscriber:


In our continuous commitment to enhance the services we offer
you, Factiva is proud to announce the expanded availability of
the Financial Times (FT).

Commencing June 16, the full text from all editions of the FT,
including FT.com, will be accessible to all Publications Library
and CustomClips customers.  The FT will continue to be
unavailable in Business Newsstand. The rollout of the full text of
the FT complements Factiva's compelling content set of top must-read
global business sources including The Wall Street Journal and
Dow Jones, Reuters and AP Newswires. In addition, this unique
source combination will be offered at launch in Factiva.com, our
new flagship product.

The full text will replace the FT Abstracts. In order to provide
you with uninterrupted coverage, the full text of all articles
from June 1 on will be made available. The FT abstract archive
to date will continue to be accessible to you as well.

This change will require no action on your part. The full text of
the FT will have the same source codes that were previously applied
to the FT Abstracts. This means your CustomClips folders and saved
searches will automatically get this expanded content - and it will
be available on day of publication to provide you with the most
up-to-date global business information.

If you have any questions, please contact your account executive.

Regards,

Greg Gerdy
Vice President and Director, Product Management
Factiva, a Dow Jones & Reuters Company

As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.  To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the "Operational Risk Committee"), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.  

Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.   

The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.  

A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:
	
Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications
Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsheet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop "rules of use" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet "books"
Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances 
Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk
Access need for additional or improved risk databases

Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.  

Thanks,

Rick Buy

Hi Shona,

Thanks for the update - I was out late last week for the RAC Conference.

Although the urgency of the situation was stressed when requesting this 
information, we followed up with an email on October 10 to Dan Houston 
(attached below) when it appeared that they would not be able to provide us 
with the information - the email gives an overview of the project and 
stresses the urgency that we obtain the documentation.

As you note that the information was there, have you already completed this 
portion of the deal test?  If not, and you would like for us to complete it, 
would you have the documentation sent to me at 3AC1904?

I have not heard anything from Pam regarding a meeting, but today looks 
good.  Tomorrow and Wednesday I will be in L.A.

Thanks, Shona,
Ken

Subject: Doorstep - Settlements

Dan,

The RAC group is currently involved in project Doorstep, which includes a 
review of Enron's trading activities worldwide.  Part of the review includes 
a deal test for each office,  in which we follow a transaction from inception 
through the settlements process.

Kyle Gibson has helped us with the settlements by providing some invoices and 
G/L entries for selected transactions.  In fact, given the deadline Kyle 
indicated to us regarding his own group's close, we reduced the deal 
population in half with the hope of concluding our testing by today.  We 
understand that the monthly close will prevent Kyle from helping us any 
further until tomorrow at noon at the earliest, and that he will be absent 
this afternoon.

Given the large number of trading offices worldwide, each "Doorstep" is of 
very short duration.  In fact, part of the testing evaluates the ability of a 
group to pull together all of the supporting documentation for a selection of 
deals within a short time frame.  Given the "short fuse," we must finalize 
our report tomorrow at the latest, and present it on Monday to Sally Beck, 
Ted Murphy, Rick Buy, and Rick Carson among others.

It is important that we be able to mention in this report that the 
settlements group is able to gather this information quickly for a small 
number of transactions (10 overall - although some information has already 
been provided by Kyle).  Are there any other resources in your group who 
would be able to help us meet this deadline?

Thanks, Dan,
Ken

Subject: Portland doorstep report - finding followed up on

Dear Ken, Leslie,

It looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation (it 
was there, it was quickly available, Ken did talk to the right people but 
they did not see the urgency of getting the information to Ken).  As a 
result, I think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in 
the Portland report.  Let's get together for 15 minutes today/tomorrow to 
draft a rewrite of these areas.  

Just as a side note, we need to wait until the report has been changed before 
we share the information with Portland.

Pam - could you organize Ken, Leslie and I getting together?

Thanks

Shona

Subject: In re Enron Claim Against ERI

Dorie and Michelle,

This will confirm my telephone conferences with Dorie this morning.  Again, I 
was able to contact Rodney Tow, and Tow reported to me that he spoke with Joe 
Walker of TMAC this morning and told him that Enron did not want him at the 
party.  Tow will follow that up with a note to Walker.

I believe Walker's confusion was created by Diane Neilsen.  Before he called 
Walker, Tow read to me a telefax that Neilsen had sent to Walker after 
hearing from Tow that we did not want Walker at the party.  The fax simply 
said that Enron did not want any type of religious orientation in the show, 
but never said that Enron didn't want him at the party.

I also asked Walker how he was doing on getting our security in place.  Tow, 
who had just walked into the office when I called, said that he was working 
on it, that he had just received a letter from Neilsen regarding it (which he 
apparently had not read), and that he had to let me go because he had clients 
on the line.

On another note:  I received a copy of a transmittal memorandum from Kriste 
Sullivan to Mike Rosen, which attaches an unexecuted copy of a confidential 
draft of the Master Consulting Services Agreement between Enron Corp. and 
Event Resources Inc. in this matter.  Kriste says in the memo that her 
records do not indicate that execution copies were prepared.

The signature blanks are for Mark Palmer of Corp. and Ken Price of ERI (who 
has left).  I was going to try to interview Price anyway regarding such 
things as where ERI kept its money, whether he believed that when he signed 
the Hilton agreement he was signing as an agent, and other matters.  I can 
also ask him if he ever signed any master agreement with Enron.  What do you 
think?

Britt

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

  CLASSIC  VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house
  and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks  the ant is a
  fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
  is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
  in the cold.


  MODERN VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering  heat all summer long, building his
  house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks
  he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter,
  the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why
  the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while  others are cold and
  starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of  the shivering
  grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home  with a table
  filled with food.

  "America" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
  country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah  with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
  when they sing "It's Not Easy Being  Green."

  Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening
  News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they
  can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by
  those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to
  it as "Temperatures of the 80's"

  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in  front of the ant's house where the
  news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome." Jesse then has the
  group kneel down to pray to God for  the grasshopper's sake.

  Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten
  rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls  for an immediate tax hike
  on the ant to make him pay his "fair share."

  Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,"

  retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is  fined for failing to
  hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having  nothing left to
  pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by  the government.

  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation
  suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a  panel of federal
  judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients
  who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when
  there are no talk shows scheduled.

  The ant loses the case. The story  ends as we see the grasshopper finishing
  up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is
  in,which just happens to be the ant's old  house, crumbles around him since
  he doesn't maintain it.

  The ant has  disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
  bought by selling  most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton
  standing before a wildly  applauding group of Democrats announcing that a
  new era of "fairness" has dawned  in America.

  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug-related incident and  the house, now
  abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the  once
  peaceful neighborhood.

Lessons of the Geese


This Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in 
"V" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they 
fly that way.


FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an "uplift" for the bird 
immediately following. By flying in a "V" formation, the whole flock has at 
least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.
LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get 
where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on 
the thrust of one another.


FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and 
resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to 
take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.
LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with 
those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and 
give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.


FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and 
another goose flies to the point position.
LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and 
sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others 
skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.


FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up 
front to keep up their speed.
LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where 
there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of 
encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart 
and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure 
our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.


FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will 
drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and 
protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly 
again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch 
up with their flock.
LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and 
each other in difficult times as well as in good!

dogs with attitudes.

By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief

    A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro 
Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner 
policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.
    At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer 
writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of 
large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German 
shepherds and bull terriers.
    "Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your 
household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to 
match the risk with the rate," said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife 
vice-president.
    "Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly."
    The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now 
shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- 
from medical treatment to "pain and suffering" damage awards.
    A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent 
of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has 
bitten someone.
    "We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers," 
said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 
companies nationwide.
    "Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot 
more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up."
    Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 
1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.
    Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a 
year earlier.
    The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said 
the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.
    Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 
million dog bites were reported in 1997.
    Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of 
victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took 
12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.
    "It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem," said his 
father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly 
at the neighbor's house.
    "I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and 
went for his throat."
    The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly 
half of all children will be bitten by age 12.
    Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, 
said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a 
particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy 
mills, he said.
    "More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls 
this year simply because there are so many more of them," he said.
    "But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The 
increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive 
animals.
    "People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often 
don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the 
mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that 
are suing."
    Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service 
now is routinely suing dog owners. 
    Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles "quite a 
few" dog bite claims and he has seen "a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly 
by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood."
    He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that 
say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.
    "There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are 
bitten by dogs," Bernstein said.
    State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, 
said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.
    "For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the 
amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm," said John Carroll, a company 
spokesman.
    The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and 
another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.
    "We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to 
bite," Carroll said. "But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the 
situation.
    "The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on 
premises."
    Dan Hattaway, a dog bite expert at State Farm's national headquarters in 
Bloomington, Ill., said the company had 14,000 dog bite claims last year -- 
up 27 percent from 1996.
    "We had been running at about a 3 p________________________________

=09=09=09=09

=09I have long thought that the PRC Process needs to be changed in order to=
 better provide the appropriate feedback and motivation as well as rewards =
that a good review process should.  I hope you will consider my thoughts ca=
refully since I have had active involvement in the process from its incepti=
on and believe that I can offer some advice that should be considered. =20

=09It appears that the results of the process have become too demoralizing =
to the employee being reviewed.  Even those that do well are suspicious of =
the process and don't particularly like it.  It causes a great deal of stre=
ss on employees and creates an atmosphere of cynicism among the people that=
 should be supportive of it.  There is a belief that the process is arbitra=
ry and that no one gets a fair hearing based on their performance but rathe=
r the results are skewed by the negotiating skills and argumentative succes=
s of any particular reviewer.  The biggest single complaint seems to be the=
 fact that an employee can be told after one review period that they are ex=
cellent and six months later be told they are only satisfactory or worse.  =
While the employee's performance may have suffered during that period of ti=
me, the message that they hear is not necessarily that their performance ha=
s declined but rather that they as an individual are not valued and are not=
 as good as they were six months earlier.  We are mixing the message betwee=
n the worth of the individual and the results of their performance.  The fo=
llowing is my recommendation to improve on this system:

=09SEPARATE THE PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES  =20

=09
=091.  Employee Skill, Competency and Character  - This category measures a=
 persons inherent skill, talent, intelligence and commitments to Enron's va=
lues.  This determinant should not change drastically between each review p=
eriod since it measures whats inside a person and that should only change s=
lowly or with the development of new skills or the hiring of new and better=
 qualified employees.  In this category a person could be told whether they=
 are excellent or superior or average and know that they have an opportunit=
y to improve on that ranking through their own effort while also realizing =
that we are continually trying to raise the bar with new hires.  This parti=
cular performance measurement is also a measure of the success of our hirin=
g and training program.

=092.  Employee Performance - This a measure of how well an employee is per=
forming the tasks of any particular job.  This measure could fluctuate much=
 more than the first since each person's performance can vary greatly over =
time based on many different circumstances.  This measure would also distin=
guish those employees who may not be considered to have the best skills or =
greatest intelligence but who through sheer hard work and determination are=
 outstanding performers.  It should also help identify those who are under =
performing and not living up to their potential as measured by the first ca=
tegory.  This category also measures our skill as managers and leaders of p=
eople since it is often the managers job to motivate people to perform abov=
e and beyond their own capability.

=093.  Results - This is a measure of the financial performance and result =
of the effort of any individual employee.  I believe this criteria is most =
suited to the commercial employees and should be the major determining fact=
or (but not the only on) in annual bonus payments.  This should be closely =
correlated to the Job Performance criteria but it may not always be since s=
ome people may be working on a long term project which has a payback at som=
e future date or in the other extreme someone could have lucked out by bein=
g in the right place at the right time and gaining the benefit from it with=
out the appropriate effort.

=09In addition to these three categories I would also reduce the Job Descri=
ptions that are included in the PRC process.  I think it is a waste of time=
 to include clerks,  assistants, accounting personnel and other non manager=
 commercial support people in the process.  Very little is gained by them o=
r by management and a tremendous amount of stress and ill will is created. =
 I would also reduce the amount of time spent on the PRC at mid year and on=
ly focus on the first two performance categories at that time.  I would als=
o change the time when the PRC review is done since now it happens in the s=
ummer when many people are trying to scheduled vacations and at year end wh=
en there is so much other business activity going on.  I think a March, Sep=
tember schedule would work much better.

=09There are probably many other ideas to improve the PRC process and I am =
sure that you are working on them.  Please give my ideas some thought and s=
ee if they don't merit some consideration.

Hi:
The big money making floor?   I don't think I like that.  Too much 
pressure...what happens if we screw up?

I went to the website and clicked on the link but all I got was a mess of 
characteres and symbols.  Any ideas how I fix it?

You're sending biz e-mails at 7:30 on Saturday morning?  You must have kids---at any rate, thanks for the note.  Am glad things worked out well and that you were so flexible re: scheduling---let me know if you need anything going forward (as I assume you will be)---and if I don't talk to you, (try to) have a terrific holiday!

Subject: Re: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals  

I'd like to wait until we get legal opinion first.  Once we know there are no 
DOL/ERISA issues (or at least some we can manage), we can set-out the process 
flow and then the companies.  I'll coordinate a conference call -- but let's 
do this after the holidays.  So many of the players are not here at the same 
time and I am sure payroll has as many year end issues as we do right now.

(Sheri, please contact Michelle Cash and Pat Mackin to get available dates 
and then set-up a conference call including the above people as well as Mikie 
Rath and Dolores Lenfest.  We probably need to do this as soon as possible in 
the new year.  Can you also include Jane Pleli, Joann Hill and Sherry 
Lessner, there may be issues with us changing current environment prior to 
7/1/2000 that we need to consider.)

Thanks

Subject: Re: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals  

For the employees to be provided with domestic benefits, they could just be 
placed on the standard domestic payroll, whereas the employees not to have 
domestic benefits could be on the new company.  As Cynthia states below, the 
new company (as a whole) would not be adopting benefit plans.  Logistically, 
there would just need to be different procedures for setting up the new hires 
on the correct company.

Also, the administration of the cross charges will be much easier once SAP 
Payroll comes online 7/1.  Currently, there is some manual intervention when 
charging from one company (like Expat Services) to the appropriate accounting 
company.

Good point, we would want to pick and choose as some may not want to remain 
on home country payroll or a home country payroll may not exist.

Michelle, can you comment from a legal perspective?

Subject: Re: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals  

The not making them eligible for domestic benefits is easy.  The new payroll 
company will simply not adopt the plans.  I am assuming that the number of 
employees (nor associated demographics) in this company will not create a 
discrimination problem.    

One question though, will we treat all foreign nationals the same or will you 
want to pick and choose who receive domestic benefits and who does not.  If 
the answer is yes to this we will probably need to run some legal traps.

Let me know if we can help.

Subject: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals

As Enron expands globally, we are faced with a growing issue of more and more 
foreign nationals entering the US on varied lengths of assignment.  For some, 
it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain 
retirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash 
balance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the 
fact they will return to their home country to retire.  If they remain on 
their home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method 
to have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well 
as receive US $.

Currently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.  He is paid by the UK a 
portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.  The remainder of his salary is 
paid on US payroll.  This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.  No 
FICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.  
Unfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as 
they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars, 
health/welfare and retirement benefits.  We indicated in his employment 
agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.

I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.  Would it be 
possible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign 
nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a 
mechanism to:

receive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US account
pay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicare
not make them eligible for domestic benefits

I would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.

Thanks,

Jane

Lynett and Cindy:

Greetings from Houston!

I have a special request for you.  In order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall, I need information regarding
internship
recruiting.

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of
particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting
firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.

By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Lexi Elliott

Doing fine - still in the boat.  At what is truly the eleventh hour, I seem to be getting calls about taking the Netco operations role.  Despite my statement of disinterest, there are those who would like to have one more conversation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed. 

I have met with Fallon several times over the last several days, but each meeting has specifically focused on information needs for E&Y relative to the estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with Netco.  Jim seems busy with these issues.  

I am meeting with Janet D. tomorrow morning at 8:00 to give her an update on an infrastructure plan.  I have Bob Hall researching the details and status of the Peoples JV, Bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in California (he is coordinating with Beth Apollo and team on the retail side).  These details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some of the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company.  

I enjoyed the dinner Tuesday night and had the opportunity to visit over dinner with a couple of people that I had not known before.  Seems like a good group.  --Sally

Sheesh.? Sorry Folks.? It's week 13  now.? Fred Taylor still had me rattled=
=20
there...
?
Joe
?
?=20

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head dow=
n=20
the home stretch, identifying  those players moving up or down can be the=
=20
difference between making the  playoffs or watching from the sidelines.?  A=
s=20
we head into our 13th week of listing these players, it=01,s  inevitable th=
at=20
some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list.? Make sure=
=20
you understand,  what we=01,re talking about is players that are moving.? I=
n=20
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis=
t=20
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I=
=01,m=20
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR=
=20
Willie  Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he=01,s still fairly =
far=20
down the  list of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction players are movi=
ng.? =20
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

?

QBs Moving Up

QB Gus Frerotte (Den)? You have  to love Frerotte stepping in and performin=
g=20
like he did.? Of course, when  you throw the ball 58 times, good things oft=
en=20
happen.? When you throw the  ball 58 times with a 62% completion percentage=
,=20
great things happen.? Look  for more of the same.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? The  Giants may be struggling but Collins continues=
=20
to put up excellent Fantasy  Football numbers.? With guys like Kurt Warner=
=20
and Daunte Culpepper, it's  easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs=
=20
come from great teams.? Not  always the case as Collins is showing.? Often=
=20
times, it's teams with  vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco=
=20
that provides the QB  motivation to play catch-up.? Collins looks comfortab=
le=20
in the pocket and  if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike=20
Hilliard healthy for four  quarters, who knows what might happen.

QB Brett Favre (GB)? He's  baaaaack.? I said last week that Favre coming ba=
ck=20
on the bad foot would be  storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an=
d=20
Favre delivered.? 2 TDs  and 301 yards have the Packers riding high and=20
believing they can?make some  noise.? WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an=20
excellent #2 WR and RB Ahman Green  is filling the void left by Dorsey=20
Levens.?=20

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? I may be  in the minority (imagine that...) but I was=
=20
very impressed with Brooks taking  over for Jeff Blake.? He was not a #2 QB=
=20
like Jim Miller in Chicago that  knew he'd be inserted any minute.? Brooks=
=20
was thrust into the game and  responded very nicely.? He's skinny at #205 b=
ut=20
tall (6' 4")? Big  league arm and nice mobility.? Of particular note was hi=
s=20
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson.? We'll see if that continues.? Sur=
e,=20
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice =20
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade=
=20
list.? Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of=
=20
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills.? Yes, there were some fluky=
=20
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw=
.?=20
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box scor=
e=20
for Leaf)? He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his bes=
t=20
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones.? He's as flaky as they come but he might be=20
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? Taylor  put together one of the best performances of=
=20
the year Sunday night.? The  fact that he did it against the very tough rus=
h=20
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive.? This isn't=
=20
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals.? Clearly, there's=
=20
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it=
=20
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis ran hard.? He's got to be consider=
ed=20
one of the better RBs in  the game right now.? I still worry about how=20
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carr=
y=20
Sunday for 187 yards.? If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin=
g=20
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi)? Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanle=
y=20
Pritchett or anyone else.?  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done=
=20
both rushing and receiving.?  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in=
=20
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey=20
Levens.? Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 tot=
al=20
yards.? Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero.? No one's ever=
=20
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing th=
e=20
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea=
t=20
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season.? As=
=20
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in=20
nicely.?? By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do=
=20
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)?  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of h=
is=20
1998 season.? He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be=
=20
over the knee  injury.? I think he's been over it physically for a while no=
w=20
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being=20
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and=
=20
85 yards including 2 TDs.? Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the=
=20
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.?  We'll see if this continues.? I=
'm=20
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but=20
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing=
=20
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get =
a=20
chance to show what he can do.?  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease=20
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.?=
=20
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)? I've  been?high on Glenn since June.? He made me look=
=20
good early on but had  cooled midseason.? He's now back warming up again an=
d=20
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off.? QB Drew Bledsoe didn't=
=20
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards.? Once again, Glenn was the prime =
=20
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)? Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as=
=20
the Jags awakened their  offense?Sunday night.? Smith seems back in synch=
=20
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.=
?=20
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug=
h=20
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal)? Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play =
of=20
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.=
?=20
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman.? Can't make plays without t=
he=20
ball...

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form=
=20
and he looks to be on his  way.? He was heavily involved and seemed=20
comfortable with "new" QB Rob  Johnson.? He can be a vital part of the=20
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a=
=20
nice target.? 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've h=
ad=20
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.

?

Players Moving  Down

?

QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)?  There's only so much a QB can do by himself.? He=
=20
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle=
=20
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur=
y=20
proved too much.? His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having muc=
h=20
time to throw.? =20

QB Shaun King (TB)? King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a=
=20
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago.? It looked that bad too.? Even for=
 a=20
Les Steckel  Offense.? Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a=
=20
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)? Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault bu=
t=20
he certainly had a hand in  them.? His problem remains a lack of healthy WR=
s=20
and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load.? Last year, it wa=
s=20
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this=
=20
year.?=20

QB Jake Plummer (Ari)? If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a=20
Plummer fan.? I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well.? He may=
=20
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles=20
offensively.

?

RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari)? Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but=20
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE)? Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is=
=20
not a very good football  player.? How else do you explain Faulk earning on=
e=20
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive?? Patrick Pass got th=
e=20
bulk of the work  but was ineffective.? I'm guessing, it's the fumbling tha=
t=20
earned his spot  in the doghouse.?=20

RB Ron Dayne (NYG)? As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's=20
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing.? If New=
=20
York is leading, you'll see Dayne.? If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki=20
Barber show.? Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne.? And if the Giants=
=20
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but=
=20
he's been disappointing of  late.? Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit=
e=20
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.?=20

?

WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)?  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it=
=20
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play.? With Shane Matthews=20
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards.? While those numbers are=
=20
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus.? He=
=20
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned rig=
ht=20
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO)? As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but=
=20
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff=
=20
Blake.? Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable=20
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes?(Car)?  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu=
s=20
for next week is  uncertain.? He's a vital part of the offense and will be=
=20
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet.? He=20
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches.? These=20
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard=20
shot.? Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit.? He looks like he=
=20
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news=
=20
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.

?

TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl)? Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any=20
degree.? When he's featured in the  gameplan, he's?a nice player and can be=
=20
effective.? It's just that  it's so hard to guess what game that will be...

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)? Another  Jet receiver that's struggling.? Becht is=
=20
frustrating as he'll show some  nice flashes and then disappear for long=20
stretches.? I'm afraid to say he's  starting to look like...a Jet's TE.

Subject:	Packets ending October 2001

Hi everyone,
Attached is the list of all packets ending October 2001.  There are several shippers that are getting cut for today's gas day, which makes their cumulative balance be off the target volume month to date.  The following are the shippers who are off target as of the 18th of October:

Duke
ENA
MidAmerica
NSP Power Pack  (the Power Pack ends in October and should have a zero balance at month end, any residual balance will be transferred to Park and Ride)
Tenaska
Transcanada
Virginia Power

Thank you for working with your shippers in getting their packets to balance.

Help yourself.  I would not recommend using the numbers that you and David are trying to use.  They are out of a table in ERMS that has no relevance to how the books are calculted.  Unless of course,  you and David know something that I don't and you guys want to start running p&l's .  Please make sure you run by John anything that you plan on giving anyone.

Thanks

Jeff,

Glad to hear from you.

Frankly, it's been a hectic week out this way as well - you may have heard 
about the HR organization being restructured. Well, it has been and yours 
truly now has until July 31 to find a job inside the company or hit the 
bricks! Not a pleasant prospect. 

I knew Enron was going to be dynamic and ever changing but I'd hoped to get 6 
months or so under my belt before it started!

In any case, I'm going to be going through the company-provided 
resume'/interviewing/job search workshops starting today. It's a humbling 
experience and also a good dose of reality - I've been the one to organize 
and conduct these types of workshops for the last 3 organizations I worked 
for and now the shoes on the other foot!

I've rambled enough - glad you found my address and I'll be reading your plan 
within the next day or so - then I'll get back with you. 

Best Regards, Jeff and thanks for your follow through.

Sandra,

My cousin sent me this.  It is so stupid but it made me laugh.

By the way the orthodontist called me last night.  What is he thinking?  I
was not home thank goodness.  SOLD!!!!!

I am not signed onto instant messenger.  I am doing some research this
morning.  I am really nervous about my interview today.

How was the massage?

Jennifer - just wanted to give you a quick SAP update - we have some traction 
still with them. We are going to provide them with a proposal for the 
4-eurpoean cities mentioned during the last conference call. On the low-end 
it is a $2.09M deal with the high-end (lower probability) could be $8M-plus.

We hope to have firms numbers to them late next week. We also had a conf-call 
with Commerce One that did not go well with respect to bandwidth, however we 
are still going to pursue the reseller potential with them for next quarter.

Also, you may want to get legal permission from Mark Taylor.

we may need to double check with John Arnold- the trader- before using them

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=
o medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets d=
o something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ e=
mployees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish thi=
s.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sen=
se of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, et=
c. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.

Sally, I got together with Hunter this morning and as a result of our discussion we have reworked the Netco Logistics list. The plan now is to get together today with the rest of the deskheads and review what you, Hunter and I have done so far. I made sure Hunter knew that you have already provided Lavo with a list based on our discussion Sunday. 

Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob

Hey guys,

	I sent an amendment to Dan McCarty, for signoff by the NNG President. last week (before the memo) and was told that Danny would no longer be signing agreements for NNG; Danny instructed me to send the agreements to Dan Dienstbier.  Well, Dan Dienstbier just told me he can't sign them either.  Who is the interim NNG President/General Manager?  Any suggestions?

Craig

Down to brass tacks, eh?  This is always the interesting part.  Quite frankly Bruce, it's a pretty good job market.  Basically I'm looking at two other prospects.  The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract, the second will not.  The base component with the first is going to be around $275/year.  The second is going to be around $250/year.   As far as incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the first to about a max of $750.  At the second I'm looking at a min of about $350 to about a max of $900.  So over a one year period, we're looking at about $725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2.

In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations for me.  Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location.  To be honest, I'm not a big buyer of Houston, so I have to factor that into the equation.  Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty confident of the above numbers.  While I'm pretty excited about the prospects of being on the "ground floor" with Cinergy, I also have to recognize Cinergy doesn't have a P&L track record for me to assess the probability of the incentive payout.  For that reason, I think, I would require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still participating in Cinergy's incentive program.  The second year I would be willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some serious money for the company.

Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you achieve your goals more quickly, and with less risk.  I also think there is serious money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at Enron.

No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time.  Please also extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in Cincinnati.

On July 27, 2001, the Commission approved the application of Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power Company to transfer operational control of certain jurisdictional transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO when it becomes operational.  The approval was conditioned on Great River (MP's only network transmission customer) reaching agreement MP on how Great River's facilities will be operated by the ISO.  

With regard to the Midwest RTO, the Commission stated its approval of the transfer of operational control does not constitute a finding regarding the scope of an RTO for the Midwest.

Please contact me if you need further information.

Good Afternoon, John!

Thanks for agreeing to be one of the Profile articles in the next issue of 
the ENSIDE.  Michelle Vitrella assured me that you would be an interesting 
topic!  Our newsletter is set for publication in February and I am setting my 
interview schedule now.  I would love to sit down and visit with you for 
about 30 minutes in the early part of December.  Please let me know a day and 
time that is convenient for you.

I look forward to hearing from you!

I have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the Ecoelectrica offices.  It looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials.  Mere possession of these materials is a violation of law.  Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not have  a duty to report it.

We also received advice that the Puerto Rico office of the FBI might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved.  Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local FBI office and talk with a duty agent.  The number is 787-754-6000.  Given the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take that route.

In any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible.

Michelle

SAN FRANCISCO, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - North American market pulp prices tumbled for the seventh time in as many months on seasonal weak demand and continued papermaker downtime. Benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) declined 7.4 percent or $40/tonne to $500/tonne, while other pulp grades fell less. 
Some producers indicated they "have no list" prices anymore as deals have increasingly occurred on a case-by-case basis, while one major producer said it had abandoned its list two months ago and has simply discounted. 
The sustained drop in prices prompted both sellers and buyers to note last week that even suppliers holding low inventories aren't able to leverage themselves in pricing. A large-volume buyer source said that his firm's discounts "are anywhere from 5 percent to double digits," even off the latest prices.
Many producers continued offloading pulp to markets such as China, South Korea and Taiwan as prices there appear to have leveled off at low levels. Market watchers last week expressed concern with global inventories and the wholesale exports to non-Japan Asian markets.
"I'm concerned with what will happen (to inventories) through July and August," said a Canadian industry consultant, who said that although pricing dynamics could improve after September, producers may fight inventory surges all year. "I hope they don't overproduce. This cycle is harsher than most cycles because of paper downtime."
Salomon Smith Barney analyst Chip Dillon noted in a report that the latest inventories are, "well above the 1.5 million tonne 'inflection' level...total inventories combined typically rise over 230,000 tonnes during July and August (so) we believe pulp prices will remain under pressure."
Various North American producers have declined selling pulp to Asian markets on below cash-cost prices, but buyers there continue to bargain hunt from second or third suppliers. Because of lower operating costs and the availability of cheap NBSK, a buyer source said that his firm's paper machines are profitably running at 100 percent through the summer season. "Some suppliers have more inventory than others and have no choice but to sell," noted the buyer.
Meanwhile, several pulp producers have attempted to offset poor demand conditions by further curtailing production. Tembec Inc. said it would slash its pulp output by at least 100,000 tonnes during the third quarter, matching the downtime it had taken through the first two quarters combined. Although Tembec didn't announce which mills or grades of pulp would be affected, an industry source said that Tembec was taking a month of downtime at its Crestbrook mill in Skookumchuck, B.C. With capacity to produce 227,000 tonnes/yr of NBSK, the mill's downtime would represent about 19,440 tonnes.
Weyerhaeuser recently told customers it would take about 54,000 tonnes of primarily NBSK market-related downtime during the third quarter. A Weyerhaeuser official said its mill in Prince Albert, Sask., would trim about 14,000 tonnes of NBSK and NBHK; 24,000 tonnes of NBSK would be cut at its mill in Grand Prairie, Alta., at a time to be determined later; and its Kamloops, B.C., mill would cut 16,500 tonnes of NBSK during outages in August and September. 
Additionally, the official expected that incremental tonnage would be lost during some maintenance downtime during the quarter. The downtime at Weyerhaeuser "reflects softness in fine paper demand," said the official. "Demand to Europe is particularly soft and with the strong dollar we have currency issues."
Other producers are reducing supplies without acknowledging their curtailments. Producer sources in British Columbia said that Celgar Pulp Co. in Castlegar, B.C., would shut down production for about 35 days due to market reasons. With capacity to produce about 425,000 tonnes/yr of NBSK, the outage could clip about 42,490 tonnes from supplies.
A source at Western Pulp Ltd. said the Vancouver, B.C., firm had extended the shutdown its 255,000 tonne/yr NBSK pulp mill in Squamish due to continued soft demand. The downtime, which began on June 1, is expected to total six weeks, said the source. Western Pulp's Squamish operation will likely cut at least 30,000 tonnes from supplies during the closure, said the source.
In Wisconsin, an NBHK mill is currently shut down for market reasons and a company source said it would chop about 20,000 tonnes from production before restarting later this month. 
"In the fourth quarter, these kraft mills can't shut down," said the source. "You have to run during the winter, but right now you can take a mill down. If the downtime isn't taken now, you will see a real bloodletting in the fourth quarter."

All,

Starting with the April accounting month Corp is cutting a day off of our 
close process as part of Project Sunrise.  This means that we will have only 
five days to get all activity booked.  I will be calling a meeting for later 
this week or early next week to discuss any issues that may arise from this 
and future implications of Project Sunrise.  Feel free to call if you have 
any questions.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

I am the ENA attorney assisting Ozzie Pagan (ENA East Origination) and Glenn 
Wright (Enron Industrial Markets) with the acquisition of two Cogentrix's 
coal fired power plants located in North Carolina.  

I understand from Kathy Neal that you are the appropriate person to be 
involved in the employee/labor due diligence efforts that were initiated by 
Dolores "Dee" Lenfest and then transferred to Kathy Neal.  If I am mistaken 
in believing that you are currently conducting such due diligence with 
Cogentrix's HR representative, would you please contact Glenn Wright 
immediately at 3-1568.  I hope there is no misunderstanding of what is needed 
or who is supposed to be assisting, but if there is, we need to get that 
figured out today.  

Thanks for your help.

This is really sick. This is an internet newsgroup where a guy as early as  Aug 31 claims something horrific was about to happen in the United States. Read  this entire interaction between a guy named Xin and a few others. Pay REAL close  attention to the dates of the message and the SUBJECT lines. This newsgroup  thing will probably make the news as early as tonight - so check it out. This  guy was obviously involved or new those involved in the whole incident.
 
This is not a joke.

As you know, I leave tomorrow for a cruise to Mexico with my family.  I will be working from home in the morning (713-218-7155 or on my cell at  713-302-5522).  The ship does not depart until about 6, so my cell should work in the afternoon.

While on board, I can be reached on ship-to-shore.  The cost is $9.50 per minute.  The number is 1-877-225-7447.  You must haven the ship's name (Celebration) when you call.

I return to Galveston at 8 am on Saturday the 24th. 

Thanks, and Happy Thanksgiving! 

Michelle

Dave, Dan and Jeremy:

As you can see from the below "stacked" e-mails we continue to have significant issues in our attempt to bill the Rexam account.  Service Management has had weekly meetings with  Billing on this account and yet this problem still persists.  While I am confident that Ben and Evan are aware of this issue we do not seem to have either the ability or the proper resources to bring it to a sucessful resolution.  

In addition to these issues on Rexam we have had a failure to follow through on a bill payment issue on a Tyco account that has caused us to not pay the utility bill for two months at the headquarters site.  This has been raised to our counterpart's attention at Tyco and though we have taken steps to resolve this event it has provided another data point in Tyco's mind as to our competency.  This is obviously happening at a important time in our negotiations.

Evan has acknowledged his accountability for building the procedures and processes that will allow us to successfully live up to our obligations in our contracts.

Craig,

This absolutely shocks me.  We really focused upon making the process
simple during the renegotiations and at last month's meeting we were
lead to believe that you had your hands around this.  For Jack to take this
much time and have so many errors is a totally non-value activity.

It certainly looks like the team from Enron needs more resources.  I'd
expect you to be prepared to explain at the monthly meeting in
Winston-Salem on the 8th what issues remain and specific action items
to resolve this problem in 2001.  We can not accept this as a go forward
process in 2002.  Is this too much to ask?




**********Below is the first e-mail.*************


Becky,

In retrospect, I wanted to comment on a few items from our meeting this
past Monday at your offices. I feel it is necessary to document what I still
perceive to be very poor performance on the invoice and account
management received from Enron. 

While I had low expectations for this particular invoice - especially due to
many of the new rules coming into play for the Second Amendment - we
still spent almost 5 hours reviewing, changing and correcting this
document. When you take into account that 2 of the 3 California plants
did not have electric invoices for us to review - and this is not Enron's
fault but PG&E's - the fact that this review took so long is not a good
sign. Ten of the twenty-one individual plant statements had some type of
error - and half of those were serious errors.

I am looking to see vast improvements in the future. I do not see us
stopping this monthly review process in the near future, and days like
Monday reinforce that thinking.

On another note, we spent close to an hour on the Natural Gas slip-up
with our Olive Branch Plant - which was inexcusable. I credit Enron for
doing the firefighting drill to reestablish nominations in time for the
November cutoff; however, the situation should have never been
allowed to spin out of control in the first place. I had to intercede with the
Energy Management representative to keep the nomination open beyond
noon to accommodate this oversight. I am looking to have Barry or Evan
provide me with an action plant to prevent his in the future.

Unfortunately, this allowed us little time to review open issues. I will
recap those we did review on future e-mails. Sometime today or
tomorrow, I will coordinate a time that we can then "resume our meeting"
via phone.

Regards,
Jack Bender

Pumpkin recipe dip attached.  

Absolutely - I would love for you to continue on the newsletter for next year.  Perhaps you would consider being the official Editor for next year?  That is the job that you are really doing!

Meagan sent her application in to OU today.  It's one of four schools to which she will apply, so nothing definitive yet.  But it is nice to get one out the door!  --Sally 

My assistant is faxing the two pages regarding news from national.

Sally - We can probably use the pumpkin dip recipe; with so many ads we may need 2 pull-out pages (calendar/minutes being one).  Plus, it would be great for everyone to have it for the upcoming holidays.
Faxing or email will be the best way to get info to me today - it's back-to-back dentist appointments, manicures (my indulgence!), tumbling, cheerleading, etc. so I will out more than I'm in.
I really enjoy the newsletter and will be happy to remain in this position for next year (if you'd like me to!).  With my advertising/journalism background - although it's been a lot of years since I've used it very much - this is just my "thing".  And with such rapid changes in technology, it's a challenge to learn new skills!
Have a great day, and I'll look for the additional info - Thanks!  Robin

Importance:	High

Please explain why factor loadings were put into production yesterday without approval.

Please roll back last night's changes immediately.

We intend to sign off the factors today and if acceptable they should be loaded today.

In future if you don't have my signature on a piece of paper, no new factors go in. 

What I require to make the decision is as follows:

1	The new correlations per the numerical method
2	The old correlations
3	A summary of primary curves
4	A summary of major positions
5	The resulting incremental change in VAR, by commodity, desk and/or major position
6	Evidence of a discourse with the appropriate desk heads/book admins about the change

Beth, lets add this to the list of tasks for the Global Middle Office and agree transition.

Attached is a proposed letter to use when rescinding an offer of employment.  I have consolidated drafts done by Fran Mayes and Terry Bosien.  If you have other forms that you think work better, please send them our way. I think it will be useful to work from the same document across Enron.

Please note that each situation should be handled consistently with others in similar circumstances, and that special care should be taken for those who have quit prior jobs, relocated, or are in precarious visa situations.

Ann:  I do not know anything about this---I very quickly glanced at the 
materials, and what is suggested presents some pretty major  issues (Michelle 
is right---there are tax issues, corporate veil issues, and possibly other 
technical employee benefit regulatory issues).  This is clearly outside of my 
area of expertise; I think this is probably more in Sharon's, Kriste's and 
Pat's area.  Why don't we discuss this at our staff meeting on Wednesday.  If 
we need to get together sooner, please let me know.   Thanks, Rex.

Do you have any thoughts/comments on the proposal discussed in the attached 
email?  Basically, the proposal is to create three holding companies that 
will house all employees of Enron and its subsidiaries/affiliates, and then 
"lease" the employees to the various business units in which they work.  
Potential issues I see include tax and corporate veil issues.

Your thoughts would be appreciated.

Sharon / Michelle / Kriste:

In late September, I sent a note on excess OASDI payment by Enron and excess 
OASDI withholdings from employees when U. S. domestic employee transfers 
occur between Enron BUs but never received a response -  note David O'Dell's 
e-mail below.  Understand Enron has looked at this area before, but feel we 
should look again to see if there are any viable alternatives to the current 
situation.

Could you please look at the attachment in my original e-mail (below) and let 
us know where we stand.how to proceed?

Thanks,

Bob

Bob,

Janice and I met with E&Y Tax Services today to discuss a number of topics 
including potential organizational structural modification strategies. One 
strategy discussed was very similar to the proposal you made back in 
September. We are planning to have the E&Y folks come back in to discuss 
these ideas in more detail. 

A couple of questions for you come to mind:
Did you ever get a response from Legal and/or Tax on your proposal?
Would you like to attend the next meeting with E&Y?

Please let me know your thoughts...

Thanks - David

Subject: Excess OASDI Payments and Withholding Issue

Sharon / Michelle / Kriste:

The enclosed document addresses excess OASDI payment by Enron and excess 
OASDI withholdings from employees when U. S. domestic employee transfers 
occur between Enron BUs.


The current situation results in significant  Enron excess OASDI payment 
annually, and creates issues with employee due to overwithholding resulting 
in employee complaints and ill will towards HR, Payroll, and Enron.  The 
document depicts apparent options, and a potential solution, to the current 
situation.  This is viewed as an HR customer service issue to ensure Enron 
employees receive the best overall service possible in their interface to the 
HR function and systems.

 It is my understanding that Enron Executive Management feel that employee 
transferability among the BUs is important, and wishes to see more movement 
of employees (as well as thoughts and ideas) between the BUs in the future to 
enhance employee opportunities and Enron's value.  This being the case, I 
would expect the Enron cost and employee impacts and issues to be acerbated 
as additional and increased employee movement occurs in the future.  

We need Legal review of the issues and opportunities as presented in the 
document to determine a solution to the current - and pending future - 
situation, and look forward to any guidance you can provide in resolving the 
problems the current situation creates for Enron employees who transfer 
between Enron entities within a tax year and to mitigate potential future 
issues.  

If there is not a Legal obstacle, we will then go to Tax to address the 
specific tax entity issues.

Regards,

Bob

Sounds great - can we get the material sent to Euorpe for our review - or I 
could do a follow up !!

Does the opportunity exist for IPTV of the 3 hours - or perhaps the final 
question and answer session?

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would "retain" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.

I believe that all of you have met Frank (whose last name I can't remember), 
the HR generalist who is currently working with Hector to serve the HR needs 
for Energy Operations in ENA.   Frank is working on a contract basis at this 
time, and Sheila Walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in 
order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the 
feasibility of bringing him in as an employee.  I have given Sheila my 
feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank 
than I have had.  Please take the time to send Sheila an e:mail message or 
voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with 
Frank.  Your input will be very valuable to Sheila.   Thanks for taking the 
time to do this.

Rick Buy informed us this morning that the BOD approved, effective today, a 
one week extension of the Temporary VaR allocation of $5MM to UK Power that 
was made last week in the e-mail referenced below.  So the limit changes as 
of 12/12/00 for Enron Europe:
  
   through 12/22/00 12/23/00 - 12/31/00 1/1/01
1) UK Power VaR $20.3MM  $15.3MM  $13.95MM
     UK Power NOP 68 Twh   68 Twh   59.5 Twh

If UK Power feels they need a VaR limit in excess of the schedule above, they 
will need to meet with Ted Murphy and Rick Buy to discuss it further.  
Currently, we have no Discretionary VaR available for allocation, but 
re-allocation from another commodity group may be technically possible at 
some point.  Although
several other commodity groups are vying for the same VaR capital.

2) European Gas - NOP and Maturity/Gap Limits revert to permanent limits on 
1/1/01 (as previously scheduled),  of 60 Bcf and 90 Bcf, respectively

3) Credit Trading - now includes the Debt Trading commodity group, and has 
one combined limit structure:
  NOP                  Maturity/Gap  VaR 
 $750,000 DV01/bp total        N/A   $5 MM
 $  50,000 DV01/bp individual


4) Commodity Group Loss Notification requirements were changed as follows 
(note: business units are encouraged to establish sub-limits):
      Effective 12/12/00  Previous
Daily Loss in any Commodity group or Portfolio:

? Report to Business Unit Office of the Chairman 100% of VaR   not 
specifically stated
? Report to Enron Corp. President   125% of VaR   50% of VaR
? Report to Enron Corp. Chairman   150% of VaR    75% of VaR
? Report to Audit Committee   no reporting at commodity  all are reported 
quarterly
group level   

Cumulative 5-day Loss in any Commodity Group or Portfolio:

? Report to Business Unit Office of the Chairman 125% of VaR   not 
specifically stated
? Report to Enron Corp. President   150% of VaR    75% of VaR
? Report to Enron Corp. Chairman   175% of VaR    100% of VaR
? Report to Audit Committee   no reporting at commodity  all are reported 
quarterly
group level

Please share with whoever else needs to know, the change in loss notification 
requirements as these are applicable to all commodity groups.


Regards,
Cassandra Schultz.

Today, December 7th, the Executive Committee of the BOD met and approved the 
following temporary limit increase for Enron Europe:

Temporary $5MM increase in VaR:   12/7/00 - 12/15/00

UK Power VaR 12/7 - 12/15  $20.3 MM  


Please revise the DPR accordingly, as will Global Energy Operations here in 
Houston to incorporate this and other changes.  The BOD meeting is this 
coming Tuesday, and I will then let you know what the permanent or more 
extended temporary limit adjustments are. 


Regards,

Cassandra Schultz.

Alert Posted: 2:45  PM November 18, 2000  RE- (REVISED) Demand Mismatch Order 
Notice
Effective Monday, November 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pools. This 
notice is revised to include the Ex- Atlanta Southern Group and The Ex- 
Atlanta Transco Group. We apologize for the confusion the previous alerts may 
have caused.
ATLANTA, EX-ATLANTA SNG,  MACON, AUGUSTA , Rome and EX-ATLANTA TRANSCO.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

Hi Sally - tough times indeed. Yes - we have provided a list of our key employees and Mike is on the list.

Let's talk soon - it would be good to catch up.

Tough times - and lots of work.  I know that you must be swamped, and that you had already been immersed in what was believed to be a tough budget process.  I am sure it is even tougher now!

Got a call from Melissa Becker today regarding retention.  On Rick's behalf, she was asking about London operations.  I assume that you have covered that.  Her specific question related to Mike.  I told her that you and I hadn't talked, and that my assumption was that you had this one covered.  Accurate?  


Take care.

Subject:	Post Mortem on ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC

Problem:  
14 ERMS EGM books were not picked up in RisktRAC due to a mismatch of attributes between ERMS and RisktRAC.  

Root Cause: The over riding issue is that the current processes to keep RisktRAC up to date are so manual that the probability of errors such as this occuring are very high (point in fact - I had 1.5 people doing this last year and now have 4 + 2 managers to support + 1 director to support them).  Specifically, what occured in this case is:

Attribute mismatches happen frequently when there is more than one commodity per in the source system book.  When setting up new books, the book admin must indicate that there is more than one commodity in the book (or that the commodity identifier ie BRN has changed to BRNT) so Risk Analytics can set up the appropriate number of books (there is not a one to one ratio between ERMS books and RistRAC books).  In this case, these books were already being used for BRNT trades.  At the end of Aug/ early Sept these books also started being used for BRN and BRCM positions as well.  The additional usage for these books was not communicated to Risk Analytics therefore no additional books were set up in RisktRAC.  Additionally, there was no effective compensating control for Risk Analytics to catch this problem.

Procedures to ensure this doesn't happen again:
Short term
1) Training - training sessions for book admins to remind them of RisktRAC requirements- pilot class has been taught and first "real" class is Wednesday of this week.
2) Compensating control to be put in place - Risk Analytics is creating a role to review all exception reporting available on a daily basis (whether a book came from the source system but was not picked up by RisktRAC, whether a book was picked up but not included for VAR purposes etc).

Medium term
Greenlight - revamping benchmarks to pull from RMS (table where data is kept for RisktRAC) so the positions per ERMS can be easily reconciled to RisktRAC, other projects within RisktRAC being identified.

Long term
Strategic vision of RisktRAC (front end & all exception reporting needed) - user requirements being developed.

Wanda's QU's not answered above:
1) How long have these books not been in RisktRAC - Our best guess is end-August, early Sept when the books started to be used for several commodity types.
2) What is the impact on VAR?  -  The preliminary VAR for Thursday's trading was $12.928 million.  This export did not have the 14 books in it.  The final VAR for Thursday morning was $12.892 million. The final had about 10 of the 14 books - the other four hadn't yet been set up.  .2% - clearly immaterial
3) What was the volume missing?  300K barrels (per EGM).  - total positions were 5.3 mil BBL for Thursday's trading - approximatly 6% - a bit more material.

What's the story on this one?  Who can best answer the four questions posed by Wanda?  How soon can we have answers?  Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM meeting today with Rick Buy, David Port, Wanda Curry, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Buy's schedule).  I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00.  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

Subject: Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were "show stoppers" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the "fixes" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems 
with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I 
talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said 
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We 
plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to 
introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos 
for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to 
postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were 
comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need 
consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the "new" streamlined version of the screens and feel that 
it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

Kim Theriot

On the chance that you might have an opening in the 24 hour group, I am forwarding my son's resume.  He graduates from Texas A&M in a couple of weeks with a degree in Finance.  I appreciate any consideration you can give him.  Thanks

McKinsey:  I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today.  Todd Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade-offs relative to that.  Would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with McKinsey.  What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with.  We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey.  


Staff Meeting Attendees:  Will Alan Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Works staff meeting?  Does he know about it for this week?  Have we made any decisions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting?  We are including Mark's directs on IT, but not their counter parts in Operations.  Including operations would make that meeting too big, so I am not necessarily suggesting that.  Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have.  (FYI - In Causey's staff meeting today, Alan mentioned that the move of the ISC under Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or Alan announced this to the people in the ISC.  Creates a bit of a bumpy start.  Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired,.  I can share those with you.  Causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with Mark in agreeing to the transition.)  

Budgets:  After meeting with Whalley last week, should we consider coming to the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars (expense and capital) of 10% or so?  That has not been our goal to date, but maybe it should be, given the stretch that Greg is trying to make.  Might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves.  I have some ideas on how we might get there.  Let me know - we would need to get that done this week.  --Sally

The Western Hemisphere Associate and Analyst PRC meetings will be held on=
=20
July 19th in Houston.  The PRC for the Western Hemisphere will include Sout=
h=20
America, Calgary, Portland, Houston and Australia (Houston administers it)=
=20

8:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and the Associate PRC will be conducted from 1:30=
=20
p.m. to 6:30 p.m. =20

III. Process

Each PRC representative has been randomly assigned 15 to 17 Associates or=
=20
Analysts that they will represent in the PRC meeting.  Please note the PRC=
=20
rep is not representing only those individuals who may work in his or her=
=20
specific OpCo but individuals that work throughout the organization.  The P=
RC=20
rep will continue to represent the assigned Associates or Analysts during=
=20
their entire tenure with the Program.
The PRC reps are expected to contact the PRC supervisor and gather=20
performance information (including pre-ratings if available).
The Program will prepare a binder for each PRC rep that includes consolidat=
ed=20
feedback from the PEP system for their assigned Associates or Analysts and=
=20
will provide this to the PRC Representatives on July 7th.
Associates and Analysts will be pre-rated by their Business Unit supervisor=
=20
using the six performance ratings (Superior - Issues) and the Management=20
Professional feedback form as detailed in the PEP system.  The pre-ratings=
=20
must be loaded into PEP by July 6th. =20
The Associate and Analyst ratings will be cross-calibrated by tenure at the=
=20
meeting as follows:
Associates:
Level 1: 0 to 6 months
Level 2: 7 to 12 months
Levels 3 & 4 will be reviewed together: 13 months+.
Analysts:
Level 1: 0 to 6 months
Level 2: 7 to 12 months
Level 3: 13 to 24 months
Level 4 and 5 will be reviewed together: 25 months+
The rating determined in the global cross calibration meeting is final, and=
=20
cannot be changed once the meeting has ended.
Following the global Associate and Analyst PRC, the Associates=01, and the=
=20
Analysts=01, supervisors will obtain the final rating from the PRC=20
representative.  The supervisors must ensure that an evaluation session is=
=20
conducted and the final rating is communicated to each Associate and Analys=
t=20
by September 15th. The completed form must be signed by the Associate or=20
Analyst and returned to Terry Bosien in Human Resources by 9/18/00.

IV. Promotions
All promotions must be recommended in the PRC.
Associates are eligible for promotion to manager at their 18 and 24 month=
=20
anniversary.
Timing.  Anniversaries that occur from April 1st through September 30th=20
should be recommended in the July PRC and those that occur from October 1st=
=20
through March 31st should be recommended in the December PRC.   If the=20
promotion is granted it would become effective on the 1st of the month=20
following the PRC, or on the Associate=01,s anniversary date, whichever is =
later.
Associates promoted after March 31st for the July PRC and after September=
=20
30th for the December PRC will be evaluated as Associates for PRC purposes,=
=20
not as a Manager  (i.e. An Associate was promoted to Manager effective Apri=
l=20
1st.  In the July PRC the individual should be evaluated as an Associate no=
t=20
as a manager).
2nd year Analysts are to be recommended for promotion to 3rd year Analysts=
=20
after completing the 2nd year, utilizing the same timing criteria outlined=
=20
above (i.e., an Analyst who completes the 2nd year on September 30th should=
=20
be recommended for promotion to 3rd year Analyst in the July PRC).
3rd year Analysts may be recommended for promotion to Associate after=20
completing the 3rd year, utilizing the same timing criteria outlined above=
=20
(i.e., an Analyst who completes the 3rd year on September 30th should be=20

Subject: Trading Track Information

As you know, we are working on an on-boarding process to get the trading 
track participants up to speed as quickly as possible in each of their 
respective rotations.  One of the methods of doing this is to have each 
rotational supervisor (you're one of them) put a few points together to 
present to each participant on the first day of their rotation with you (or 
someone in your group).  

For example:
What does you group do as a whole?  The Risk Management Group is responsible 
for providing information to the trading floor.  That information consists of 
positions,  p&l,  and other general information which may be needed by the 
floor throughout the day.  The information must be 100% accurate 100% of the 
time as the gas floor is taking positions based on the information they are 
given.  In addition,  all reports go to SR.  Management such as John Lavorato 
and Dave Delaney.

The participants need to know several logistics type things such as:
 where to sit
 User tips on the use of related business hardware (i.e. phone system, 
intercom, etc.)
 How long/when or if to take lunch: use your discretion.
 Expected working hours: Expect to be in the office no later than 8:00 and 
preferably by 7:30

It is also important to cover the expected learning criteria with the 
participants on their first day:
 able to work under pressure - You will be asked to provide reports and 
answers to questions on the floor quickly.  You will be expected to know and 
understand the information that you are giving.
 ability to handle multiple priorities - There will be times when you are 
faced with several tasks at once.  You will be expected to make quick 
decisions and understand which is the most important.
 meets deadlines - Everyday in Risk you have to meet a deadline.  The traders 
must have positions and p&l on their desks when they walk in in the morning.
 Excellent written communication - Your written communication will be in the 
numbers that you provide to the floor.
 Excellent oral communication - Again,  the traders will expect answers and 
expect them quickly.  You will need to articulate those in a fashion that is 
understandable.
 Effective interpersonal skills -  see above.
 Attention to detail - This is one of the most important considerations of 
the job.  Again,  all information must be 100% accurate,  errors are not 
acceptable.
 Team player -  You will be expected to work across all groups upstream and 
downstream to provide accurate information and solve related problems.
 Excellent organisational skills - speed and accuracy are a hallmark of the 
job,  therefore you will need to be organized at all times.
 Is a motivated worker -  self explainatory
 Excellent analytical skills - same
 Maintains relationships with traders -  The trader will be relying on the 
information that you provide him.  Therefore it is important that he trusts 
what you are giving to him and that you are always asking if they need more 
or better information.
 Effective time management -  self explainatory
 Competent in Excel -  Alot of the work we do is in excel.  It is important 
that you be able to navigate excel, as well as create efficiencies to make 
the job less prone to errors and to run more smoothly.
 Competent with ERMS - ERMS is the system that is used to maintain positions 
and p&l.  All deals flow through this system and all values related to deals 
come from this system.
 Competent with Risktrac - Risktrac is the system that tracks counterparty 
risk and Value at Risk.  I expect you to understand what each means,  what 
the limits are,  and how you can reduce and add to value at risk.
 Demonstrates knowledge of trading concepts - Work with the traders to 
understand why they are putting on the positions that they have.  Try to 
understand proper hedging strategies etc.

Each participant who comes to your area needs to know your interpretation of 
each of these competencies so they can make sure to meet your expectations 
while in your area.

Also, the participants need to fully understand exactly what they'll be doing 
in your area.  Let 'em know with as much detail as possible.

Finally, Do you consider any information a pre-requisite for participation in 
your area ?(i.e. Advanced Excel skills...etc)
I'd like to know so we can push the participants to get the needed training 
before coming to your group.  Advanced Excel skills,  preferably a level of 
understanding of positions and value at risk.

Please compile this information and forward it to me so I can put it into 
some on-boarding material for all of the candidates by their first day of 
rotations.

The first candidates will begin on February 1, 2001.  

Thank you very much for you time and consideration.

We are set up for the meeting on Operational Risk on February 6th at 3:00 
pm.  We have a room booked at the Sheraton with a set up similar to the 
Houston meeting.  I have invited three people from the accounting department 
to attend as well.  Laura Scott, Cheryl Dawes, and Dave Hanslip will be the 
attendees from accounting.  Everyone is looking forward to meeting with you 
to discuss this issue.  So far, the weather is still mild.  Talk to you soon.

The invoices for November 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by
23:00 today, Monday, September 17, 2001.  The NYISO apologizes for any
inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.

Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to:
(1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing
process;  and  (2)  adjust  the  NYISO clearing account balance to zero for
November 1999 settlements.

With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these
adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant
data fix.  As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments
is  done  through  adjustments  outside  of the billing process.  The total
adjustment of $14,178.39 was allocated across 5,059,790 MWh.  Customers may
validate  their  respective  adjustments by computing their ratio shares of
the  $14,178.39  using 5,059,790 MWh as the denominator in their respective
ratios of their November 1999 load.  Customers will observe a difference in
the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment
versus  adjustment  #2.   This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for
adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the
adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.

Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the
revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of
forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred
by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.  In October
2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions
that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be
settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in
October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.  This results in
an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an
adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.   This  billing treatment for the
November  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market
totaling  $5,583,559.78  allocated  across  5,074,229 MWh.  Customers where
allocated  their  portion  of  this  adjustment based upon their respective
ratio  shares of the 5,074,229 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for
the month.

November  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to
address  the  delay  in  invoicing.  Payments due to the NYISO for November
1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing
account on Monday, September 24, 2001.  Payments due to market participants
will  be  made  on  Thursday,  September  27,  2001.   Please  refer to the
attachment below for banking instructions.

The  NYISO anticipates that the 2nd settlement adjustment for December 1999
settlements  will  be  invoiced tomorrow, Tuesday, September 2001 by 23:00.
Settlements  dates will be adjusted to accomodate the invoice date changes.
Given  the aforementioned schedules, payments due to the NYISO for December
1999  settlement  adjustments  will  be  due  to  be  received in the NYISO
clearing  account  on  Tuesday, September 25, 2001.  Payments due to market
participants  will  be  made on Friday, September 28, 2001.  The NYISO will
confirm the invoicing schedule for December 1999 settlements tomorrow.

Regards,
Randy A. Bowers
Manager - Customer Settlements

Lucy, 

Here is a rentroll for this week.  

What is the outstanding balance on #1.  It looks like 190 + 110(this week)= 
300.  I don't think we should make him pay late fees if can't communicate 
clearly.

#2 still owe deposit?

#9  What day will she pay and is she going to pay monthly or biweekly.

Have a good weekend.  I will talk to you next week.

In about two weeks we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy 
the property.  I will keep you informed.

Phillip

GRAB A SEAT, AND JOIN ME FOR MY DINNER WITH BILL GATES

    On the eve of Windows XP's launch, I joined
         14 other journalists for a private dinner
         with the chairman and chief software architect
         of Microsoft.  We had one thing in common: When
         Bill talks, we write about it. And on this night
         he was talking, and just to us. Here's part
         one of what Bill had to say.

    WILL THE PATRIOT ANTI-TERRORIST BILL BETRAY US?

    A new anti-terrorism law, which significantly
    expands law enforcement powers, is
    speeding into law. So now we'll see:
    Whether Congress, with our assent,
    acted wisely or whether we allowed fear
    to lead us astray.

  BEYOND THE HYPE: SEE WHAT XP HAS TO OFFER IN OUR FULL
  REVIEW

   The birth of Microsoft's newest operating
         system was arguably the most-hyped OS launch
         all of time. What's behind the noise? Josh

  SERIOUS ABOUT SECURITY? BETTER DOUBLE YOUR OPTIONS

   Think user IDs and passwords are adequate?
         Think again. Those single-factor security
         systems are quite vulnerable. Add a second
         element, such as an ID card, and the solution's
         more secure. David looks at the promise--and
         the difficulties--of two-factor security.

Topics I would like to discuss are:

what is currently reported in the DPR (accrual vs mtm)
company/location groups - what we are currently not capturing
relationship with the risk policy
Economic vs earnings risk - what should be captured

I strongly encourage you to attend as your input will be very valuable in

  Pete Van De Gohm of EES has again raised the topic of inventorying our 
trade secret protection which has been discussed from time to time.  I have 
visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing 
your major groups.  It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K 
committee did.  We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general 
instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine 
what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting 
our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue.  
Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared 
proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to 
a specific operating group.
 
  I believe we need this inventory.  If we try to enforce our non-competition 
agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know 
basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.  

  Jim asked that I contact each of you regarding this to see if you were in 
agreement with the proposed plan.  Please respond as soon as possible if you 
agree so we can get the project off the ground.

"Mark Younger" <mdy@slater-consulting.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding.  The $150 price is the
lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be any
mitigation.  This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is
highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed.

The $150 price will not trigger mitigation in and of its.  Whenever one of
the zones has a price that is above $150 the AMP will run to determine if
any units have crossed the conduct threshold.  If there are any units that
have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their
reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact
threshold has been triggered.  If the impact threshold is triggered in any
zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated (i.e. reference)
bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold.  If the impact
threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be
used.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a
minimum $150. How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified
in the market mitigation plan. A 300% increase would be $450 and an
increase of $100 would be $250, and yet using the AMP interpretation of
the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding
is $150.
It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market
Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator
conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not.

The simple question would be is the $150 threshold representative of
every generator's bid to determine economic withholding. The answer can
only be no, how can it be?

The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator
was exercising market power. The determination of whether a generator
was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all
of the prevalent market, unit and system conditions to determine if that
unit was in fact exercising market power. The more complex the system
the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power
determination. The full facts are presented and evaluated, every case is
unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact.
In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the
NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution.


I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high
as a result of market power. A better solution would be to delay the
prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made. In
the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they
should be held in reserve for determination of market power. Prices can
be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power,
at least then due process can be followed. Market participants can be
consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun.

External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are
consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is
required for market power evaluation. The AMP is still in place but is
only used to identify potential market power until a "human" evaluation
is done.

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says "internally" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Jim,
 
I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.
There will be a total of four schools that I am applying to.
   1- Yale
   2- Boston College
   3- University of Massachusetts
   4- Bocconi University (Italy)
 
Thanks,
Monika

Hi -
 
I would contact the other finance guys here. Who knows, they may have some great leads. As far as the letter is concerned, I would be happy to do it. Generally, however, each grad school has a specific recommendation form that they want references to fill out. So let me know after you get the required info from the schools. Typically, students just send it to me as I will probably have to submit it directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential letters.

Jim,
 
I did write to Eric Hughson about the PhD program and I am waiting for his response.
In the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter. I know you don't like to do this but if you would it would be great. I am planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now. I will mail the paperwork to you on Monday.
Also, should I contact the other finance professors at OSU trying to see what they can help me with?
Thanks for all your help. I will keep you posted.

Hi Again Monika -
 
Here is what I heard from my former professor. If I were you, I would contact Eric Hughson about CU's PhD program in Finance. It is worth a try.
 
I will contact you if I hear about other opportunities either for graduate study or employment opportunities. Keep me posted.

Hi Jim,
It has been a long time between communications.  We no longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus does).  We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU <mailto:Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU>.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific recommendations.
Ron
PS--I also still like the teaching part of the academic life and probably won't be retiring for another few years.

Hi Ron - 

It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun.

The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree.

Our College of Business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works very hard. 

Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you put her in touch with the right person at CU?

If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the information on to Monika?

Thanks for any help you can provide. 

Best regards, 

Jim

Marty,

Gracie Presas is asking about training for ENA for harassment.  As we 
discussed, I think it would be a good idea to offer several sessions to Enron 
global wholesale and ENW, to maximize efficiency.  So, I told her to call you.

The lawyer contact on this is Kerry Notestine at Littler Mendelson.  His 
number is 713-652-4748.  Thanks.

FYI

I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin 
interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be 
the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top 
MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR 
for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our 
recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners 
and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron 
Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview 
team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages 
during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  

 I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be 
the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia 
School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is 
a short one.

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 
Importance:	High

Gerry/Lynn:

Yes, the volume nominated to the inlet/from the outlet is factored into a firm contracts MDQ total.   

At a high-level,  there should be no special MDQ-related coding at Bushton inlet/outlet that causes an override (per se) of a contract's MDQ allowing shippers to "double" their contract MDQ. 

I did a preliminary check (using model office) to confirm coding logic at the nomination level......looking at K#6425 (BP Energy) that has a total contract MDQ of 20,835 MMbtu.   When nominating above the 20,835 K# MDQ; you can only nominate to inlet/from outlet up to the contract's MDQ utilizing transaction type 01 (current business).  Any additional vols. nominated above the contract MDQ must then be nominated as transaction type 02 (overrun).  

We do have shippers that nom in to & out of the plant on the same contract... .....initial research indicated there are contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton; i.e., same contract nominating to inlet is the same contract picking up the gas at the outlet.    The IT Group ; however, could run a quick report to check/confirm this.  

Hope I answered your questions......

Subject:	FW: Questions on MDQ 

	Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?  Gerry
	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking
	with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of
	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can 
	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  

	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical
	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone
	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 

So when a shipper is required (because of the producer's processing rights) to nominate from their primary receipt point to Bushton Inlet and then from the Bushton Outlet to Demarc, is that treated as one nomination from a receipt to a delivery OR is that treated as two nominations on the same contract with one receipt at their primary receipt point and another receipt at the Bushton Outlet thus exceeding the contract MDQ sending the shipper into overrun (assuming the shipper was nominating the entire MDQ throughout the path)?

Didn't we also have a situation where shippers were going from a receipt point to Demarc and not going through Bushton when they were supposed to--or maybe it was that shippers were going from Bushton Outlet to Demarc and not getting charged fuel when they weren't supposed to be able to do that transaction--I just remember something happening not too long ago.

Thanks for the help with these questions.

Subject:	Questions on MDQ 

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

George,

 I received the drawings.  They look good at first glance.  I will look at 
them in depth this weekend.  The proforma was in the winmail.dat format which 
I cannot open.  Please resend in excel or a pdf format.  If you will send it 
to pallen70@hotmail.com, I will be able to look at it this weekend.  Does 
this file have a timeline for the investment dollars?  I just want to get a 
feel for when you will start needing money.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

<font SIZE="-2" FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" color="999999">November 15th 2001<br>From The Economist print edition
</font>
<br><br><br clear="all"><div><font face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><b>Gains in trade</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">The world's trade ministers agreed to launch a new round of trade talks at the <b>World Trade Organisation meeting </b>in Doha, despite the misgivings of India over the treatment of poor countries and France over the phasing-out of farm export subsidies. Broad agreement was, however, reached on one issue dear to poor countries: rich countries agreed to make it easier to override patents on drugs to treat malaria, <font size="-1">AIDS </font>and other diseases.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">
<a href="http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34335_6627519_2_79987158_60345293_1_69">See article: The Doha round</a>
</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1"><b>China </b>signed up to become a member of the <font size="-1">WTO</font> after many years of negotiations. As part of the deal, Taiwan joined at the same time under its Chinese name, Taipei, and with no explicit recognition of its sovereign status.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1"><b>Nasdaq Europe </b>is to ally with the small <b>Berlin Stock Exchange</b>. This marks the American market's first foray into Europe. Nasdaq is still eager to team up with a bigger European exchange, possibly London's.</font></p>
<br clear="all"><div><font face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><b>Running out of energy</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1"><b>Enron</b>, Houston's mighty power-trading company, was taken over by <b>Dynegy</b>, a hometown rival, in an all-share deal worth some $10 billion. Enron's shares had crumbled in the wake of revelations of unorthodox financial dealings. Dynegy has saved a company that once dwarfed it, but it may yet suffer from Enron's undisclosed liabilities.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">The <b>OPEC meeting </b>in Vienna, intended to shore up oil prices, ended in disarray after members put off planned production cuts until Russia and other non-<font size="-1">OPEC</font> countries join in. Oil prices immediately fell sharply; some analysts speculated that they could fall to $15 or less per barrel over the next few months.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1"><b>Newmont Mining</b>, America's biggest gold producer, bid to become the world's biggest.

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1"><b>Japan Airlines</b>, the country's leading carrier, is to take over the third-largest, <b>Japan Air System</b>, in an effort to cut costs as passengers turn their backs on airlines after September 11th.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">American <b>retail sales </b>shot up by a record 7.1% in October, driven mainly by car sales, which leaped by 26.4% over the same period. General Motors extended until the start of 2002 its &#8220;Keep America Rolling&#8221; scheme of zero-interest financing on new vehicles introduced to boost car sales after September 11th. Ford and Chrysler had introduced similar offers. The scheme has clearly been a great success for now, though profitability and future vehicle sales are likely to suffer.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Americans have reacted to the slowing economy by shopping in lower-cost stores. <b>Wal-Mart</b>, the world's biggest retailer, said that sales had risen by a record 15.5% in the latest quarter compared with a year ago, pushing profits up to $1.5 billion. J.C. Penney and Home Depot also made gains.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Luxury-goods companies are usually the first to suffer as a recession approaches, and <b>LVMH </b>is proving no exception. It issued its third profit warning in eight weeks, putting the main blame for its troubles on the American market.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1"><b>Vodafone</b>, the world's biggest mobile-phone operator, announced pre-tax losses of &pound;8.4 billion ($12 billion) in the six months to the end of September. The loss reflects write-offs of the value of assets it bought during the telecoms bubble. Its shares gained as its core mobile-phone services continued to perform well. Vodafone also said it would like Britain's government to improve the terms for third-generation mobile licences.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1"><b>Marconi </b>at last accepted that it had heavily overpaid for American telecoms firms acquired near the height of the telecoms boom. It announced pre-tax losses for the latest half year of a whopping &pound;5.1 billion ($7.3 billion) after drastically reducing the value of its transatlantic assets. The companies, purchased for cash, have left Marconi with a heap of debt.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1"><b>Cable &amp; Wireless</b>, a telecoms company, said that it would use part of its &pound;4.1 billion ($5.9 billion) cash pile to buy back shares and pay a special dividend to the tune of &pound;1.7 billion. The company said it would still look for acquisitions to put some of the spare money to work but said it was in no hurry.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Profits at <b>Siemens </b>fell by 76% in the year to the end of September to <i>euro</i>2.1 billion ($1.9 billion), including restructuring charges and a write-down of assets at the German engineering giant's mobile and fixed-line telecoms divisions.</font></p>

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

What are your thoughts on Team Leadership?  Several of the managers in the 
group were using them last year for coaching and I have received very 
positive feedback.   I would like for them to be able to continue with the 
counseling, but wanted to see what you thought.

Thanks!

Sally - HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Sorry I missed your call last night; I
was walking with another prego from the office.

Your payment offer is very generous;  I"m sure we can work it out.  I have
no problem putting it on my card for now.  We have the go-ahead from Cindy,
too - so I think I will go ahead and confirm with Jeffrey's this week.  When
you come in next weekend, maybe we can all look at the sample menus, and get
that decided as well.

Maybe we should send a little "save the date" note to the cousins to let
them know?   I would be glad to do that.

Thanks for your input.   I bet I will talk with you later today, on your
special day!    -cara

FYI

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. Evidentially the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.  

We are pursuing this matter with Bill Donovan and the building/security staff.

Is there any way we can get a heads up as to when our "photo op" with Claire Shipman will air?  It looks like it will be a nice piece and I would like to catch it.

Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1123/1283244.html


Rookie Anthony Thomas, who has emerged as the Chicago Bears' top running
back this season, may miss Sunday's NFC Central clash against the Minnesota
Vikings.

Thomas, who has 638 rushing yards and four touchdowns, has been downgraded
to doubtful for Sunday's game with a strained right hamstring.

James Allen, a 1,000-yard rusher last season who lost his job to Thomas,
likely would start if Thomas is inactive for Sunday's game.

This is a crucial game for both teams. The Bears (7-2) need the victory to
stay ahead of the Packers in the Central, and the Vikings (4-5) need the win
simply to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


It's a dice roll here, folks.   He hasn't practiced all week and James Allen
has been working with the first team.   If you don't have anyone close to
Thomas' ability, you might roll the dice with him but if you've got another
option, I'd probably go with the safer route.   From Coach Dick Jauron's
eyes, I'm guessing he sees Allen as not a horrible choice plus the fact he
wants to get Allen healthy for the stretch run and playoffs.   Just my guess
though.

Thanks Larry for passing this along.  This is good news, if in fact the good doctor has isolated the solvent contact time (so the solution has maximum effectiveness as the entrained pigs apply it to the walls of the pipe).  That was one of the issues that bothered me most about the effectiveness of an application.  Would the solvent be uniformly applied and in the proper timeframe so that the PCB's would be absorbed and transported to an pre-determined extraction point?  It sounds like the model is ready.  After you receive the report and if you agree, I would be willing to discuss with Louie another no-cost extension.  John

Dear Larry:
It was good hearing from you a few days ago. We are wrapping up a progress
report on the project but I can tell you briefly what we have accomplished
so far. We have finished the PCB model development/modification to
incorporate most of the main ideas that we talked about when you, John and
your crew visited us. Specifically, we have been able to extend the model
significantly to include flow regime impact on cleanup efficiency and the
amount of solvent that will be required. We have looked at the issue of
contact time and contact area. These two and some of the other salient
issues turned out to be more challenging to handle than we had originally
anticipated but we have now nailed them. In fact, the new program finally
worked well and debugged only about 2-3 weeks ago. Since then we have been
doing shake-down testing and all is well so far. The results are exciting as
you would see in the report. There are two tasks that we would now embark
on. Now that the model has all the principal mechanisms incorporated, we are
now planning a comprehensive production runs where we will give you cleanup
options, etc with critical evaluations of those. That will probably take us
until the end of January. This is where I will need to talk to you very
often to determine what options make most sense to run so that we do not
just run millions of options.
	Along this line, we will need another no-cost extension letter from

	Team, I would like for you to review the attached Shipper assignment list.  With Renee leaving and
	Pat still on a learning curve, I wanted to throw out some possibilities and get your input.  I did not
	spend a lot of time on interconnects, so you may want to look at those closely.  I did talk with John,
	Terry, Raetta and Larry for input.  Please review, discuss and set up some time to visit with me about
	your comments.  Thanks. Lynn

I think if we had to recover our money from Renaissance, it would be difficult. However, the fact we charged it all on Platinum Amex, and the insurance coverage the card provides for goods/services not received and/or defective, we should receive from Amex 100% of the money, just like the letter said with was faxed to you by Amex this a.m. You did good dear. However, looks like Eric lost all his money because he wrote us a check, which is not covered. Too bad. LU-L7

What do you think?
Renaissance may not be able to repay millions of dollars in passenger deposits. Unlike most U.S.-based cruise lines, it does not sail ships from U.S. ports and so has not posted the customary $15 million bond with the U.S. Maritime Commission to protect cruise passengers.

Hiya,

Why don't you let me take care of the flowers--I'll call Tarrytown Florist
and pick up the flowers for the 2nd.  I'll also do flowers for the tables.
Can you forward me the email from mom?

Do you have an idea of what you want in the announcement--I'll take care of
that as well.

Am still curious about that statistic regarding siblings of MS people.  I
know that the agent that causes MS is found in people moving to the
NorthEast (or other industrial North sections)--but if you are born there or
move there as an infant, you are generally immune.  Also, if you move there
past a certain age--like 12, you are also not at risk.  Think that is
particularly interesting since our move to CT proves that out--Cara was too
young and you were too old to be at risk....will still ask again next time I
see the neurologist.  It's amazing how you learn to cope--I sort of forget I
have MS most of the time.

I think Geoffrey wants to take you to dinner...he's thinking of flying
down..

Cindy

WW II Codes and Ciphers

 http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/

This homespun site was created by Tony Sale, a man instrumental in
preserving, restoring, and curating the historical collection at
Bletchley Park. Headquarters of British code-breaking during World
War II, Bletchley was "Britain's best kept secret" -- the place
where the German Enigma was finally deciphered in an incredible
cooperative super-effort. Detailed tutorials for the mathematically
inclined explain how the Enigma cipher machine worked and how the
Lorenz code was broken by the British-built Colossus machine. A
Bletchley Park photo album presents snapshots of an ordinary-looking,
extraordinary place.

--------------------

The Brownie Camera @ 100: A Celebration

 http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/features/brownieCam/brownieCam.shtml

In February of 1900, the Eastman Kodak Company introduced the
Brownie, a compact portable camera that cost $1. During the first
year, over 150,000 cameras were sold. The Brownie was designed and
intended for children, but it's explosive popularity led to the
birth of popular photography, the rise of photojournalism, and the
all-American snapshot. Kodak's gorgeously designed site offers
dozens of recollections, original advertisements, audio commentary
clips, and plenty of Brownie-shot snaps.

--------------------

BoondocksNet.com

 http://www.boondocksnet.com/

This site was created by historian and Mark Twain scholar Jim Zwick.
It began in early 1995 as a page about Twain's writing on the U.S.
expansionist war in the Philippines; since then, it has become an
essential library of historical texts, articles, photographs, and
political cartoons for the study of imperialism and anti-imperialism
in the late 19th and early 20th century. Remarkable e-texts and
related gems include: Arthur Conan Doyle's The Crime of the Congo,
Hull House founder Jane Addams' The Long Road of Woman's Memory,
and an interpretive archive of 3D stereoscopic photographs. And
the title? Boondocks, which means rough country, is derived from
the Tagalog word for mountain, and entered American English around
the time of the Phillipine-American War.

--------------------

Antimatter: Mirror of the Universe

 http://livefromcern.web.cern.ch/livefromcern/antimatter/index2.html

>From CERN in Switzerland, the amazing particle physics laboratory
that brought us Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web, comes this
introduction to antimatter. Tune in on November 21 to a live
educational webcast produced in cooperation with San Francisco's
Exploratorium or listen anytime to the archived presentation. Take
a guided video tour of the Low Energy Anti-Proton Ring (LEAR), a
particle accelerator that lets scientists create and observe
antimatter in a quest to understand how the universe works. Read
about Paul Dirac and the history of antimatter or see how it has
seeped in to our daily lives.

--------------------

Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World

 http://www.nypl.org/utopia/

In bilingual collaboration with the BibliothSque nationale de France
(France's national library), this exhibition explores the roots of
utopian thinking from ancient traditions to modern times. Travel
from the Garden of Eden to the City of God, then on to Thomas More's
definitive 1516 work, Utopia, a word that means both "good place"
and "no place." The exquisite image collection covers the Enlightenment,
19th-century revolutionary dreams, 20th-century dystopic nightmares,
and 21st-century metaworlds. The paintings and illustrations will
make you wish you were going nowhere too... or would that be
Erewhon?

--------------------

This is SportsCenter

 http://espn.go.com/thisissportscenter/

Which is better: ESPN's SportsCenter or the commercials for the
show? If you're a fan of the latter, you'll enjoy this rotating
selection of choice ads. No dumb beer ad humor here. SportsCenter
ads are like tiny Saturday Night Live skits: self-deprecating,
offbeat, and usually very funny, even if you don't like sports. So
treat yourself to a two-minute sanity timeout.

--------------------

short stories at east of the web

 http://www.short-stories.co.uk/

British web-design firm east of the web presents this splendid
collection of short stories organized by theme: fiction, romance,
crime, sci-fi & fantasy, humor, horror, hyperfiction, children's,
and non-fiction. How perfectly civil of them. Most of the stories
are wonderful, and thanks to public interest copyright law, they're
all free. Read them onscreen, print them out for the train ride
home, or download them onto your Palm Pilot.

--------------------

Lego Star Wars Trilogy

 http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mbsf/

The product of over 2,500 hours of monomaniacal determination, the
Lego Star Wars Trilogy recreates 180 key scenes from the original
series. Relive all of those magical moments through Lego-lensed
glasses: the Tatooine races, the Hoth battles, the Ewok dances.
You won't find any Millennium Falcon or Imperial Walker Lego sets
in stores; these are all custom-made models. As your Japanese host
S. Fujita proclaims, "I completed this project by myself without
any support." Thank you, S. Fujita.

You had asked us to review the employment agreement under Mississippi.  Here is the analysis we have.  As I mentioned, we do not have any lawyers actually resident in Mississippi, so we did the work here.  This analysis seems comprehensive enough.  Let me know if you need anything else.

To:     Notestine, Kerry 
Subject:        ENA agreement- review for compliance with Mississippi law 
Generally, the agreement is compliant with Mississippi law.  It is not hard to comply with Mississippi law when it comes to employment agreements.  Mississippi is pretty much the opposite of California in regard to employee rights.  Mississippi does not have many restrictions.  Plaintiffs' employment attorneys would probably starve in Mississippi if it weren't for federal laws.
Mississippi allows non-competes and protection of trade secrets and confidential business information.  It has a pretty broad view of what is included in that category, so I think the agreement is ok in that regard.  Specifically, the case law says that a covenant not to compete may be enforced if "necessary for the protection of [the employer's] business and goodwill."  See Texas Rd. Boring Co. of La.-Miss. v. Parker, 194 So.2d 885 (Miss. 1967).  The validity and enforceability of a non-compete is predicated upon the reasonableness and specificity of its terms, primarily, the duration of the restriction and its geographic scope.  See Redd Pest Control Co. v. Heatherly, 248 Miss. 34, 157 So.2d 133 (1963).  To be enforceable, the covenant must strike a balance between the interests of the employer and the employee, and its enforcement must not pose a threat to the public of monopoly or unfair competition.  See Empiregas, Inc. of Kosciusko v. Bain, 599 So.2d 971, 975 (Miss. 1992).  
Incidentally, even if the court found the terms and categories of a non-compete to be too broadly defined, that would not be a problem because Mississippi courts can blue pencil those types of things to make non-competes enforceable.  The time and geographic restriction in this agreement would most likely be found to be reasonable under Mississippi law, as other courts have upheld similar restrictions.  The only concern I have in that regard is that the agreement says it will be enforceable even against an employee who is termed without cause, and Mississippi law holds that Court's should not enforce non-competes if the employee was terminated in an arbitrary or capricious manner or in bad faith.  However, I don't think that means we need to change the language in the contract, I just think you need to advise the client of that fact so it cannot expect to be able to terminate an employee in bad faith and still enforce the non-compete.   
Mississippi allows for employment agreements to be arbitrated.  Thus, the arbitration provision is fine.  The only thing I might add is a clause which says, "The arbitrator selected may not have any interest in the subject matter in dispute, nor can he be related by consanguinity or affinity to the parties entering into this agreement" because that is a requirement under Mississippi law.
Incidentally, my only other concern is that the agreement says it will be governed by Texas law.  Choice of law is an unsettled area in Mississippi when it comes to employment agreements/non-competes in Mississippi, so there is no reason why the client cannot insist on such a provision.  However, the client should probably be advised that such an area of law is always subject to change and it might be enforced by a Mississippi court regardless of what the agreement says.

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.

The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. 

Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.

Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7.

A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002.

Any idea what amount of switching in gas equivalents does the implied demand 
of resid equate to?

JA:
See note on switching. It is hard to monitor the distiallte because any 
switching is being absorbed by the incessant arrival of European cargoes. We 
hope to have you guys some better numbers before the end of the week.

PIRA report attached - bit uninspired this week, like the stats.

Crude went back to the usual pattern and built 2 .4 mbbls, as opposed to an 
implied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5). Perhaps 
surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and 
gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. 
Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 
kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold 
weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well 
above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur 
material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. 
However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.
Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not 
the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? 
Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. 
Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.
Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly 
high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.

 Latest NBA Player News=20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

 Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on th=
e=20
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured=
=20
list since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw=
=20
Dec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the=20
injury.   =20

 Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised=20
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks=
=20
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.=
  =20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a spraine=
d=20
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewi=
s=20
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but=20
doesn't have much Fantasy value.   =20

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=
er=20
the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=
=20
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined=
=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  "Oak," who wa=
s=20
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy valu=
e=20
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deepe=
r=20
leagues.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=
t=20
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=
y=20
latest, so add a little "Vinsanity" to your starting lineup next week.   =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00=20
 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The=20
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court =
on=20
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.=
=20
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights=
=20
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, giv=
e=20
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.   =20

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but=
=20
has very little Fantasy value.    =20

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Nash returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two=20
straight games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by=
=20
the injury as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is no=
w=20
safe to play Nash on your Fantasy team again.    =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is questionable for=20
Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters Bryon Russell and=
=20
Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid using Marshall unt=
il=20
he appears to be fully recovered.   =20

 Kevin Garnett , F MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00=20
 Garnett hurt his right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to=
=20
have it examined Wednesday.  He is expected to play against the Wizards=20
Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.  Something as simple as an injured=
=20
finger on his shooting hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his=
=20
Fantasy numbers.   =20

 Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles=20
tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit=
=20
longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his career and doesn't have mu=
ch=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's game against the Heat=
=20
and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the Magic.  Keon Clark=
=20
will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.  The leg is sore=
=20
now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few days.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00=20
 Hill may be ready to return to the court for Thursday night's game against=
=20
the Nuggets. He has missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he=
=20
practiced on Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court.=
=20
"I can't give you the official thumbs up," said Head Coach Doc Rivers, "but=
=20
it looks good." Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will=
=20
likely get him back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a=20
four-game West Coast road trip.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 According to The Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful=
=20
that Trent will travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing o=
n=20
the East Coast.  Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but coul=
d=20
be back in action in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the=20
first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a goo=
d=20
inside scorer and a solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does retu=
rn=20
Fantasy owners should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately=
=20
need a forward.    =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marbury missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of a=
n=20
ankle injury. He turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turne=
d=20
it again the following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is=20
still lacking some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankl=
e=20
is diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host=
=20
the Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have the=
ir=20
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes. =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Carter was in uniform for Wednesday night's game against Portland, but he=
=20
didn't see any playing time. "Air Canada" said that he felt well enough to=
=20
play, but team doctors wouldn't give him permission to get in the game. "We=
'd=20
like to have him back as soon as possible," said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens,=
=20
"but we're not going to bring him back before he's ready." Toronto finishes=
=20
their three-game West Coast swing on Friday night against Golden State, at=
=20
which time Carter hopes to make his return. The Raptors' star should be bac=
k=20
before Monday, so most Fantasy owners can re-insert him into their lineup i=
n=20
time for next week.   =20

 Andre Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 Miller took a knee to the nose during Wednesday night's game at Chicago=20
which sent him to the bench temporarily. He returned to the game with a=20
vengeance, finishing with 20 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in=20
Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot to the nose won't keep Miller from=20
missing any playing time, so continue to use the young point guard in your=
=20
starting lineup.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Brand missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night against=20
Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his hyperextended left kne=
e,=20
and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.  Brand is listed as day =
to=20
day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance of playing on Friday=20
night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring on Monday, Fantasy=
=20
owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their lineup for next=
=20
week's games.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/06/00=20
 The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan=20
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the=
=20
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per=
=20
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but=20
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes=
. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Dudley will travel with the Suns on their end of the week road-trip that=
=20
starts in Milwaukee Thursday.  He will most likely be questionable for all=
=20
the games.  Look for him to finally return to action next week.  With Dudle=
y=20
out of the lineup Corie Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to=
=20
get playing time.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding=20
makes him a starter on your Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his=
=20
position.   =20

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Lakers because of pain =
in=20
his right ankle.  He was scheduled to see a foot specialist on Tuesday and=
=20
underwent surgery last season to remove bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mil=
ls=20
on your Fantasy bench for now.  If you are playing in a small league drop h=
im=20
from your roster and add another forward.    =20

 Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mercer sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu. =
=20
Corey Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's stat=
us=20
for Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment =
so=20
far this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your=20
roster, if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The=
=20
way Mercer has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a bett=

guard.   =20

Not so impressed with David goldman.  For a guy who has worked in derivatives for 10 years, couldnt answer some simple questions.  Very poor financial derivatives knowledge even though he worked at CRT for a long time and a Lyonnais for a while.  The only value I see in him is that he worked at BP for a while and might have some knowledge as to how they work.

All:  

As part of the TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Hearing, it has been suggested that the following modification to CAS and other associated systems be made:

EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a receipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested shipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it doesn't provide the IS's the "last look" auction their looking for, it at least provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if capacity is available (eliminates any claim of "tortious process"); disadvantage: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time).

This was drafted by an attorney without considerable consultation with Gas Logistics.  

A settlement offer that includes minor tariff changes will be provided to the parties in the proceeding this week.  Although this will buy some time, a scope and cost estimate needs to be determined so that if the modification above is offered, we know what the cost is.    

Alma:  Please schedule a 1 hour meeting with anyone on the distribution and if anyone else should be included, please let Alma know.  

Brad

I thought it may be helpful to review my notes on information needed to
respond to the Botchlett/Straub charges (although I know you have notes on
the information needed).  We need: 1. The name, title, description of job
function (e.g. had crude oil trading portfolio) and ages of all persons
reporting directly to Wade Doshier and John Nowlan for the period 1/1/99 to
6/1/01 and what happened to them in the organization (e.g. still there,
transferred, terminated) including dates.  For each person if they had
established P&L goals in each year what they were and how well they did
against the goal. 2. The P&L for Botchlett on his own books (as opposed to
his team result) for both 1999 and 2000. 3. The organization charts for the
group managed by Doshier then Shankman back to 1995 if available. 4. Data on
Straub's actual presence in the building from security.

I know you get this daily log stuff all of the time, and probably ignore it, but wanted you to check out the new  - more summarized reporting that we are instituting at the 8:30 meeting.  I think Rick Buy liked it this week, and hopefully this will lead us to more conclusions/trends than just reporting incidents that appear random.

A small step, but one in the right direction...

Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on?  The reason I 
ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that 
the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well.  I'd just as soon 
we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be 
replaced.  Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status.

Thanks.

Larry,

The ENA Accounting groups have had wires for our NYMEX and OTC margin calls 
sent back due to improper signatures.  The timely flow of these monies is a 
vital component to our trading organization.  I believe that these two items 
fall under category "B" of the policy memo that was distributed (see email 
below) and therefore should only require the signature of an Accounting 
Director.

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

We have a contractual obligation to our brokers and OTC counterparties to 
provide margin according to the guidelines set forth in our agreements with 
them.  These margin calls / returns of margin are monitored and amounts 
signed off on by the RAC Credit Group (Bill Bradford's area).   Backup from 
the Credit group should  be and is included with each wire.

I would appreciate your consideration of the above arguments to facilitate 
the movement of these monies on a go-forward basis.  I will call you tomorrow 
to discuss the possibility of having this change in effect for Monday Dec. 
11.  Thank you.

        Greg x35399

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a "Workflow" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Tim,
 ET has had wholesale changes in its personnel recently. Here's the
three contacts that I talk to:

 East   John Ed James  713-371-6673
 Midwest  Tom Dickey   713-371-6163
 West    Allen King    713-371-6123

 If they can't handle the transaction, they know who can. Note that
both John Ed James and Tom Dickey will be leaving the company at the end of
the summer. Allen King is basis backup for the West, but he has always
handled my FOM deals (Allen will be moving with ET to Bethesda). Minor
intramonth changes usually can be done by the scheduler at ET, they'll tell
you if you need to talk to a trader.

  Thanks,
   Scott

Dear Richard

Here's to wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!!! I 
think that 2002 is going to be a much better year than 2001!!!!!

Here's a great article from the most recent issue of Fast Company. All

indicators point towards a turnaround.

Digital Matters - Issue 52
Most everyone has written off the dotcoms. Smart investors are finding
the 
real value.
by Fast Company
illustrations by Jack Unruh
from FC issue 52, page 74
Alt Text

Every nine months McKinsey and Co., the world's premier management 
consultancy, publishes an "e-performance" survey of more than 200 Internet

businesses around the world. These dotcom companies have combined revenues

of roughly $2 billion. The most recent survey, published in May 2001,
found 
that 20% of the companies covered were profitable and that a significant

number of the others were heading in that direction.
Dotcoms that were making money were "e-tailers," with clothing e-tailers

doing particularly well. Companies that were losing money were content

sites; news and sports sites were struggling the most. Monika Kubicova,
one 
of four McKinsey consultants who oversee the survey, told the Financial

Times, "For e-tailers there is quite good reason for optimism, with a

reasonable number starting to show profitability. Content businesses,

however, are still playing with their business models and are in the red."
The McKinsey survey received virtually no press coverage, because it did
not 
fit the major media's prevailing conventional wisdom, which is that the

Internet sector in general -- and the dotcom sector in particular -- is
as 
dead as smelts. But as the survey makes clear, for something so dead,
these 
sectors are showing all kinds of life. This past July, a streamlined 
priceline.com announced that it had turned a second-quarter profit. Google,

the search-engine site that is now run by former Novell wizard Eric Schmidt,

recently announced that it was solidly profitable. EBay, Travelocity.com,

and a host of other companies also reported strong second-quarter earnings.

All of these solid performances occurred in the teeth of a global economic

slowdown.
Indeed, the big, largely unreported summer story of 2001 was the renewal
of 
financial interest in all things related to the Internet. Goldman Sachs
and 
other major investment houses swarmed across Europe, bottom-fishing among

distressed telecom and wireless properties. Deal flow in 
Internet-infrastructure companies quickened in the United States as price

points became much more "realistic." Even seemingly doomed content companies

such as Salon.com attracted funding.
A couple of years from now, people will look back on the summer of 2001
as 
the time when the music started up again. Dan Burstein, a managing partner

of Millennium Technology Ventures LP ( MTVLP ), is one among many smart

investors who see the wind shifting. For almost 15 months, Burstein says,

MTVLP didn't see a deal that was worth the price of admission. In fall
2000, 
MTVLP knew of one that was priced at $1 billion. By spring 2001, that
exact 
same deal was valued at below $100 million. At $1 billion, the deal was
an 
almost perfect metaphor for Internet insanity. At below $100 million,
it was 
a good investment. MTVLP bought a stake. Burstein sees the current situation

as analogous to the savings-and-loan crisis and the great real-estate

collapse of the late 1980s to early 1990s. The S&L meltdown led to 
write-offs of more than $500 billion and caused a meltdown in the 
real-estate sector. At the time, there was much talk about "overcapacity"

and "glut" in the real-estate mark!
ets. Today, the telecom industry may have to write off anywhere from $300

billion to $1 trillion in bad debt. And that has caused severe distress
in 
the Internet-infrastructure world.
Having worked at the Blackstone Group LP prior to setting up MTVLP, Burstein

has good institutional memory of what a big opportunity looks like. Under

the direction of former commerce secretary Pete Peterson, Blackstone 
surveyed the wreckage of the S&L/real-estate crisis and decided to establish

a separate entity to get in on the action -- even though Blackstone had
no 
prior experience in real-estate investing. The company ended up buying

packets of properties, and when the market revived in the latter half
of the 
1990s, Blackstone sold them off at a staggering profit. Burstein thinks
that 
the telecom and Internet shakeout of the past two years is an investing

opportunity of similar size and scope.
Consider the prevailing wisdom that there is a bandwidth glut. You can
read 
a thousand research reports on the Internet, and invariably you will find

someone whining about this glut. It is certainly true that the information

superhighways running down the fiber-optic lines between major metropolitan

areas are, for the moment, underutilized. But does that mean that they
will 
be underutilized in five or seven years?
The likely answer to that question: Of course not. Pervasive computing
means 
that new appliances, new security systems, new HVAC installations in 
buildings, whether commercial or residential, will communicate with server

farms to exchange information constantly. Peer-to-peer technology will
have 
computers talking back and forth to one another, constantly updating 
information for millions of end users. Gaming will continue to grow and

become for the echo-boom generation what television was for the baby 
boomers.
All of these technologies will be added to an ever-growing traffic flow
of 
email, messaging, searches, and business communications. Enabling all
of 
this technology will require enormous amounts of bandwidth and gargantuan

amounts of what George Gilder calls "storewidth": the response time between

entering a request on the Web and getting back the first page. Bandwidth
and 
storewidth companies have been hammered over the course of the past 18

months, to the point where they are now selling at relatively reasonable

prices. Like the real-estate glut of the late 1980s, the bandwidth glut
of 
the early 2000s is almost certainly a temporary phenomenon. So it's not

surprising that major investment houses are scouring the countryside,

looking at Internet-infrastructure companies that will enable the coming
of 
all of these new technologies.
It will take a number of years before we know which investors made the
right 
bets. The secret of business success is that much of it derives from luck

and timing. But after 18 months of virtually no activity, with huge pools
of 
investment money sitting on the sidelines in cash accounts, the great
game 
has quietly restarted. Investment companies are back at the table placing

their bets. And the biggest bets are being wagered in the beleaguered

telecom sector, which makes sense. European telecoms in particular overpaid

for spectrum licenses and, in doing so, jeopardized their franchises.
Now 
they must sell off key assets to stay afloat. Those assets are selling
at a 
significant discount. Situations like that attract big money very fast.
The next wave will occur in the Internet-infrastructure sector as companies

with strong market positions but weak cash flow hit the wall and grow

desperate. The last wave will be in a whole range of dotcom companies
-- 
especially shopping bots. As peer-to-peer computing advances, shopping
bots 
will not only be able to find you the best price on any given item, but
they 
will also give you the ability to auction out your business. Kids need

back-to-school clothes? Bid your business out on the Internet, and the
Gap 
will have to offer you $1,000 worth of merchandise for $850. If it doesn't,

Target will.
Ever since April 14, 2000, the question has been, When is this thing (
the 
Internet business, for lack of a better phrase ) going to turn around?
The 
answer is in that McKinsey survey and in the behavior of some of the world's

leading investors: It's turning around now. If the S&L/real-estate crisis
is 
a suitable analogy, it'll take about five years to get from here to there.

Along the way, there's lots of money to be made.

GENERAL DEPARTMENT MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE PAPER TIMESHEET TRANSITION TO ONLINE APPROVAL:
 
If you approve timesheets for Enron Temporary Workers in the administrative/clerical area, this message is for you:
 
Contingent Staffing Solutions (CSS), which provides centralized management for Enron's temporary staffing providers and temporary workers, announces the transition from paper timesheets to online timekeeping.
 
In our ongoing effort to provide greater efficiency and order accuracy to users of Enron Temporary Workers, a temporary worker for whom you must approve time will now enter time online through GRi, the CSS online application that tracks and reports temporary staffing usage.  Once a temporary worker submits his or her time, e-mail is generated that is sent to you, the approver, prompting you to log onto GRi to review the electronic timesheet. 
 
Your logon is:   DonBaughman              
Password is:     DBaughman      
Organization ID is:    2160                                
 
You will be prompted to change your password. 
 
During the transition period, you may have some temporary workers using paper timesheets and some using GRi.  Soon, all paper timesheets will be phased out and all admin/clerical temporaries will report time using only GRi. 
 
We appreciate your cooperation and welcome your feedback during this transition.  You will receive online approval instructions at the time of the order.  Please contact Gwen Chavis/Craig McGee/Liz LeGros at 713-345-6899 if you have any questions.
Please find attached training for order entry and time sheet approval.

1.  The University of Texas
2.  Arizona State
3.  UCLA
4.  University of Florida
5.  University of Arizona
6.  Florida State

Because of other matters on its agenda, FERC removed the Mirant complaint
against the NYISO's implementation of the Automatic Mitigation Procedures 
(AMPs)
from its agenda on April 25.

In order to give FERC an opportunity to consider the Mirant complaint, the 
NYISO
has determined that it will delay implementation of the AMPs until after 
FERC's
next scheduled meeting on May 16.

Dona,

Ok as to evening drinks.

As for Saturday, walking with Lilly while you get your hair done is a good idea.  Lunch or something would work for me, but just remembered that I have a facial 4:30pm on Saturday.

I am so glad that you will be able to attend.  I will have a fully developed 
draft agenda available within the next couple of days.  It may help to know 
that the plans for Sunday will start with a cocktail reception at 5:00 at the 
hotel, followed by dinner at the hotel at 7:00.  We hope to have Mark Frevert 
join us that night to informally address the group.  Sunday night will be 
low-key, as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to 
Houston.  On Tuesday, the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon (3:00?), so 
that some of the London participants can fly back to London that evening.  I 
do believe that some will stay Tuesday night and will plan to have meetings 
in the Houston office on Wednesday.  If that is the case, I will also arrange 
a dinner for Tuesday night.  Hope that this helps!

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Please note Carla McGinley, an Ashford UMC member and friend of mine, is going on a Walk to Emmaus weekend retreat the middle of March, 2002.  It will be held at the JbarJ Ranch in Sealy.  In an effort to help her sponsor Kathy Eason and to encourage Carla we respectfully ask your assistance as well.

Some of you know Carla very well, others only slightly and some not at all; and yet you do know me.  When I went on my own retreat to Emmaus in 1994 I was incrediably blessed then only to realize over the years since the blessing has continued.  We don't always feel the warmest effects of an effort until God chooses it so. I have since served on many teams over the years and each time I am allowed to be present as a person gets time for her/himself I am blown away by the effects of honest heartfelt prayer in action.  Now that Carla has taken the responsibility and position of coordinating the prayer ministry for our church home, Ashford UMC prayer is requested in her name.  

Would you be so kind to either mail or email an encouraging note, bookmark or other thought to me FOR HER and addressed to her so that I can take the messages to leave for her on the walk.  She will not know of these or receive them until she is on the weekend These messages will mean a lot reminding her of the vastness of her brothers and sisters in Christ in prayer; of God's love sent in many forms and will encourage her as she returns to serve the Lord in her famiily, church and the community. Having thoughts from some who know her and SOME WHO DO NOT will touch her I know. These notes will show her as an agape physical form the unconditional love that God has for us.  Her walk will be March so please forward asap to ensure receipt.  I will be participating as an outside 4th day along with her official sponsor Kathy for those of you that have already gone on the walk...join me/us if you l! ike.  

Kathy Eason is her walk sponser. Prayer for Kathy in her support of Carla, the whole walk team, retreatants and their families as well will be the greatest agape (unconditional love gift).  God bless each of you as you take the time to share ideas, a love in Christ thought, a card or a letter of encouragement for Carla as she spends this time away from the daily world and spends it in the Lord with others on her journey.  Nothing brings the heart more encouragement like an unexpected love in Christ message from another person during this time away from the everyday world.

Feel free to ask others that know Carla to join in the messages and forward to me by early March for delivery mid month.

Please notes mail to me for her:

P.O. Box 441150 Houston, TX  77244-1150  (you may enclose a sealed note for her if you prefer)
or email as follows:  maggiemschf@yahoo.com <mailto:maggiemschf@yahoo.com>

All will be delivered to her in their original form faithfully and to His glory.  serving in Him with Joy, maggie

Hi Folks,

Once again, our Footballguy Scott Luebke throws out what he sees for this
week's Upgrades and Downgrades.

Enjoy.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades

QB - Tom Brady - Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the
return of Drew Bledsoe from injury.  Some analysts may question the fact
that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury, but no one can question Brady's
effectiveness on the football field.  A 258 yard, 4 touchdown performance
keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter.  Keep in mind, the Patriots
have a bye in week 16.

QB - Kordell Stewart - Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second
consecutive multiple touchdown game.  Stewart finished the game with 254
passing yards, 54 rushing yards and 3 total touchdowns.  The schedule looks
good for Stewart down the stretch, especially with games against Detroit and
Cincinnati in weeks 15 and 16.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris
Chambers.  Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season, but his
upside is good.  A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season
should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.  Look for another quality performance against the 49ers
this weekend.

RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season, Rhodes
has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense.  He produced on Sunday with
147 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  Two consecutive difficult games against
Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down, but a strong finish to the season
is in store.  With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions, look
for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes.

RB - Antowain Smith - Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with
153 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  However, now is the time to trade Smith
away.  His value has hit an all-time high and the remainder of the season
will be difficult with Cleveland, Miami and a bye week remaining.

RB - Ahman Green - Green has struggled the last few weeks, but was able to
bust out on Thanksgiving Day with 150 total yards and 2 scores.  Look for
the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the
season.  As the winter weather approaches, Favre and the passing game will
become more conservative, which will result in more dump off passes to the
talented Green.  Don't be surprised if Green receives 30+ touches/game the
remainder of the season.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's statistics have suffered over the
last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run.  In order to get
the ball in Tomlinson's hands more often, Turner called several short
passing plays to get LT in the open field.  The plan was successful as
Tomlinson caught 13 passes for 72 yards.  The fantasy playoffs look good for
Tomlinson with Oakland, Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks
14, 15, and 16.

RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with 106 rushing
yards and 2 touchdowns.  In the last 4 games, Hearst has averaged 106
rushing yards/game.  With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on
Sunday to go along with an already injured quad, Hearst will continue to see
20+ touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs
as long as he remains healthy.

WR - Derrick Alexander - Good news for Alexander owners...it appears that he
is 100% healthy for the first time this season.

WR - Eric Moulds - Throughout the week, Moulds was complaining about the
lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him.  Well,
the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball.  What
happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds?  He produced (196 yards and 2
touchdowns).

WR - Chris Chambers - The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with
101 receiving yards and 2 fabulous touchdowns.  Chambers is the big play
threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action.  Keep in
mind, Chambers is a boom/bust option at receiver.  He'll dazzle you one week
and disappear the next week.  This guy is going to be special, so grab him
in dynasty leagues.

WR - David Boston - Plain and simple...the man.  A few weeks ago, the knock
on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring.  Well, 4 touchdowns in 3 weeks
should quiet the critics.

WR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday
with 113 yards and a touchdown.  Johnson is Tim Couch's clear cut #1
receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the
season.

WR - Troy Brown - Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent
basis.  With 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, Brown
continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady.  Keep in mind, New
England has a bye in week 16, so Brown will not be available for the
majority of championship games.  Plan accordingly.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downgrades

QB - Trent Green - Green's disappointing season continues.  He looked good
with 256 passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday.  However, he was
unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade.  With
the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver, Green's stock could be on
the rise in the near future.  Green's value is at its lowest point, so you
could probably get him for relatively cheap.  He's not an every week
starter, but he might have a few big games left for this season.

QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the
last two weeks (221 passing yards and 1 touchdown).  His pride of wanting to
be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production.
McNabb's value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some
plays. Right now, McNabb should still be considered a top 10 fantasy
quarterback.  However, if his lack of production continues, his stock will
drop quickly.

QB - Brian Griese - Griese's receiving options are limited, which is
directly affecting his production.  Rod Smith limped through Thursday's game
with an ankle injury.  A healthy return of Smith will boost Griese's stock.
However, Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver
position.  His production is limited, if he is forced to throw to the tight
end position the majority of the time.

QB - Daunte Culpepper - Culpepper did not pass/score a touchdown for the
first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings.
Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week.

RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held out of Sunday's game with a hamstring
injury.  He's expecting to play this weekend against Detroit, but this is
not a guarantee.  With James Allen being effective, it would not surprise me
to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy
hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs.  A big game looms in two
weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that
game.

RB - Emmitt Smith - Smith was held to 9 yards on 9 carries during the
Thanksgiving Day game.  Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game,
Smith's numbers will remain meager.

RB - Ron Dayne - With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option
in the rushing game, Dayne's fantasy value has dropped very low.  Dayne had
26 yards on 6 carries.  Barber had 124 rushing yards on 19 carries, 5
receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown.  Keep Dayne on your bench.

RB - Jason Brookins - Brookins broke his foot in Sunday's game against the
Jaguars.  He is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks.  Drop him and add someone
else to the roster.

RB - Eddie George - George's disappointing season continues with 58 yards on
15 carries this past Sunday.  George is currently tied with Randy Moss for
"Fantasy Disappointment of the Year".

RB - Maurice Smith - Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to
return to the game.  However, Smith gained a meager 57 yards on 21 carries
and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain.  Evaluate his progress later
this week.

WR - Jimmy Smith - Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after
being pulled over by police.  No legal action will occur, but some sort of
suspension could be handed down by the commissioner's office.  Not a good
sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs.

WR - Peter Warrick - Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland
on Sunday. He was held to 1 reception for 22 yards and has not scored a
touchdown since week 4 of the season.  Keep him on your bench until the
Cincinnati passing game reappears.

WR - Randy Moss - Moss was held to 25 yards on 4 catches Sunday night.  Moss
is the most talented receiver in the league, but appears to lose
concentration from time to time.  Keep in mind, his potential for explosive
games is enormous.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire

Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.

RB - James Allen - Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and
performed admirably.  With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury, it's
highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this
weekend.  Chicago's defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on
the ground.

RB - Travis Minor - With Lamar Smith averaging just 2.3 yds/carry over the
last 6 games, Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon.  In his
limited touches, Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a
much needed spark.

WR - Chris Chambers - This guy is good.  See description in upgrades
section.

TE - Eddie "Boo" Williams - I had Williams on the list last week and his
play on Sunday deserves another mention.  Although he had just 2 catches for
44 yards, Williams has explosive potential.  He nearly scored on a 25 yard
pass play, but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second.
With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury, Williams is a tight end with
quality upside.

Karen - RE the Q below -  
	Will I still receive severance if the company files bankruptcy?
Draft Answer - It is unlikely that severance payments would be continued.   Current or former employees of a bankrupt entity are generally considered as unsecured creditors, in line with other unsecured creditors.  Employee claims will generally be represented through a court designated trustee.

Mary, based on the most current information:  
1.	A&B employees will receive bonus consideration however the amount is not dependant or determined by their A / B designation.   Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.  
As result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown) 
2.	The employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.  Michelle Cash is working with Pat Mackin to define the severance plan features that will govern this timing and the corresponding explanations.

I have a couple of questions about the scripts that Rick Johnson sent me

1.  For A and B employees, will there be bonuses.  It's crossed out on the A script and left in the B script.
2.  In the C script:
	Please explain what a 60-day notice w/o severance plan off-set means.
	When does severance go into effect for C employees?  It's not clear in the script.

Thanks.

Don, 

Joe is a guy you definitely want to consider.  In fact, we wanted to bring him into our group, but we are in a hiring freeze and with the changes occurring in our group we don't know when we would be able to bring him in.  Anyway, just wanted to give you some feedback.  Hope you didn't get drowned out this weekend!!

Take care,

John

Michelle,

Please draft a separation agreement for Andrea Hauser.  Nowlan/Shankman have agreed to compensate Andrea for the 6 month non-compete period.

Andrea will be in the office on Monday to sign the agreement and is leaving the country on Tuesday.  Will it be a problem to have the agreement by 10:30 on Monday?

Thanks,
Shanna

Don:

I'm "touching base" with you in following up to our recent meeting and
subsequent discussions. It is my understanding that our TNE team (R. Heidorn
& G. Simpson) are scheduled to meet with your co-worker R. Imai on 10/8.
That's great news as we move ahead in developing our business relationship.

Coinciding to the above, I will be taking the lead in constructing the
license agreement. The main points and highlights that I would like to
review are as follows:

1. License to include Peak/Off-Peak data; w/ history and updates
2. Six (6) month term (no charge to Enron)
3. Distribution rights defined to departmental limits (TBD)
4. Portal access-five (5) total/specific users
5. Licensed access for use within particular database that Enron envisions
(TBD-10/8 meeting)
6. Enron will use its best efforts to make a market for TNE-Cinergy Index
7. TNE becomes active (through your endorsement) and operating on Enron
OnLine within 60 day
   cycle
8. Enron contributes trades to TNE index production cycle

Don, we are excited about working with you regarding this cooperative
opportunity of mutual benefit.

Please confirm your understanding of the above with me. This will insure
that we are on the same page and comparing "apples-to-apples".  Thanks.

I have two questions about the Service Requester Scheduled Quantity report
that came on line this week:

1.  Does it have to be legal size?  The previous report was very readable
and it was 8 1/2 x 11, landscape

2.  This report gives no month-to-date totals and now I have to get two
reports on each pipeline every day in order to reconcile our system
correctly.  Is there any way the first page of the old report could be added
to this report so that month-to-date totals can be seen?

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

In U.S. East spot markets, northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp prices declined just over a percent while hardwood spot transactions took a larger fall since July 2. Traders said that although some suppliers had pulled out of spot business, availability of various grades was still plentiful.
Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest dipped $5/tonne to $420-$450/tonne, or 13 percent below July contract prices, paperloop sources said. Southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK) on the spot market also fell, down $5/tonne to $400-$430/tonne.
"Prices are still eroding in the States (because) a lot of spot is still available, it's all over the place," said a supplier source. But he added that spot prices had eroded so badly in Asian markets that he pulled out altogether. Previously, some suppliers had diverted tonnage to Asian markets because of stronger demand for hardwoods there.
Both hardwood grades fell in the U.S. by $10/tonne on oversupply as producers tried to edge down their inventories. Northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) closed the week about 18 percent below July contract prices at $340-380/tonne. Southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) also ended at $340-380/tonne, but the lower end prices were partly keyed by low freight costs. One source noted that in the Northeast some buys were in "the low 300s."
"We have a ton of hardwood (available)," said a Midwest buyer source who indicated he was recently offered about 2,000 tonnes of spot NBHK at $360.

Dear eric,




 

The Rockets tip off the 2001-2002 regular season tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. against the Atlanta Hawks at Compaq Center. The first 14,000 fans entering Compaq Center will receive a new 2001-2002 Rockets magnetic schedule, courtesy of Miller Lite. In addition, Rockets representatives will distribute small, American Flags to the first 2,000 fans. 

You can purchase your tickets for Tuesday's game at any Ticketmaster outlet, the Compaq Center box office, or by calling 1-800-4NBA-TIX. You may also order tickets online at rockets.com. (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=127374&UID=45456540&MID=182309)

The game will feature a special ceremony including presentation of $86,000 to the Twin Towers Fund, which will go to assist families of uniformed service heroes in New York City. Fans can also show their patriotic support for our nation by putting their signature on a giant 15-foot tall, 50-feet wide banner, presented by 950 KPRC-AM, which will be sent to New York City.

Please be sure to get to the arena early to accommodate the new security measures now in place at Compaq Center. These new measures include:

There will be an increased security presence both inside and outside
Compaq Center Briefcase-size bags and pocketbooks will be allowed in Compaq
Center, but will be inspected at all entrance gates Large bags, coolers and large backpacks will not be allowed in
Compaq Center Once they have exited, fans will not be allowed to re-enter Compaq
Center for any reason All vehicles without proper identification must be parked at least
100 feet from Compaq Center, in arena-controlled parking areas All media and others with access to restricted areas will be
required to produce a photo ID, and all bags and equipment will be subject
to inspection

(Donations to the Twin Towers Fund were made possible with proceeds raised
from ticket sales and a special silent auction at the Clutch City Classic on
October 11, 2001, when the Rockets hosted the Dallas Mavericks during the
preseason home opener.)

Sally, 

Thanks for your message this morning.  Attached is an E-mail that Amy Gambill 
sent out along with Todd's resume.  I was a little worried about forwarding 
Todd's resume directly to Shona since her husband is an ERM/Audit manager at 
KPMG.  Todd wants to make sure that noone at KPMG finds out that he is 
interested in Enron.  I thought it would be better if you forwarded his 
resume to Shona along with a note insuring that  this is keep quiet.  Please 
feel free to call me with any questions about Todd and thanks again for your 
help.  I honestly believe that Todd is a top performer at KPMG and would make 
a great addition to your team.

Thanks,

John

Hi guys!

This is an employee referral which came to me from John Mackel in EES.  I've 
spoken with Todd, and though he is happy in his position with KPMG and not 
actively seeking other opportunities, he would not mind exploring 
opportunities at Enron should a good fit for his skills come up (John's been 
telling him wonderful things about Enron).  He would be particularly 
interested in a trading analyst/P&L/mid office type position.  John had 
mentioned Sally Beck's world to me and Todd mentioned the same.

If any of you do have anything in mind, please let me know.  Should any of 
you consider contacting Todd, it might be best to contact him at home.  Since 
he is happy with his current employer, he was really concerned with 
confidentiality when we spoke.  I assured him that you guys always handle 
contacting prospective candidates with a great deal of respect for their 
privacy.

I really enjoyed my conversation with Todd.  If any of you guys have openings 
which may fit his skill set, I think he'd really be worth giving a call.

Thanks!
Amy

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Kerry,

As you are probably aware, the EES Risk Control organization is moving under Sally as of April 30, 2001.  Our initial thought was we would keep all the former EES employees together in a new ENA accounting entity, but have now decided that the Risk Control group needs to be captured as part of Enron NetWorks.  These were previously set up under a new ENA company number (#1596).  I don't know if within SAP we can simply repoint the profit and cost centers set up below to roll-up under ENW now instead of ENA, if not, we will need five new ones set up as follows:

	Executive (Meredith Eggleston)-27101 [Simper, Keith]  ,150260
	Risk Analytics (Neil Hong)-27102 [Simper, Keith]  ,150261 
	Strategic Operations, Process & Systems (Scott Mills)-27103 [Simper, Keith]  150262 
	Deal Capture/Confirmation (Meredith Eggleston)-27104 [Simper, Keith]  ,150263 
	Global Data Management (Mark Evans)27105 [Simper, Keith]  ,150264 

Thanks and don't hesitate to call with questions.

Thanks

Wade

Jeff,
I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a 
professional manner.  I thought I had moved on from being an emotional basket 
case , but as we found out, I haven't..  Again , please accept my apology.  I 
just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.  It is  so  
difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that 
still doesn't see value in you.  But, that is my problem not yours.

In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is 
so Shankman)  - Sorry I will not be able to attend. But thanks for asking.

And lastly, Wes Walton how?  2001 Candy Apple Ferrari !!!

Sally- 
I made a mistake in saying that we would have the London report ready for your review today.  We are not currently keeping a cash collections report on the London cash receipts to the detail that we are here in Houston and, therefore, have not been able to determine the "cash received" percentages for the month of September.  However, Pamela Lebrane of Project Sunrise has said that a report containing the required information will be available and easily accessable as a download from SAP by the end of October.  As a backup, the London office has agreed to maintain a side spreadsheet for the month of October which will keep track of all invoices due during the month and the timeliness of cash received.  Either way, we will make certain to provide an EGM consolidated report for the month of October.  I do apologize for the inconvenience. 

Attached below is a revised version of our Houston report that we had provided on Friday.  I noticed that I had included invoices that were due in August as well.  A hard copy will be delivered to your office tomorrow.

Regards,

Michelle

Thanks.  As far as I know the Plan document should now be in its final stage.  I'll await to receive hard copies for signature by appropriate exec.

Lizzette's changes to the plan document look good to me. 
When the plan document is finalized, we will prepare unanimous consent resolutions for adoption by the board of directors of the two participating employers.  It has always been the Enron practice to have an employer's board of directors approve such a plan for purposes of corporate governance.

SAN FRANCISCO, July 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Various major market pulp producers have further increased their downtime plans -- scheduling an estimated 767,402 tonnes during the third quarter -- in a more aggressive attempt to bring inventories in line with expected demand. 
Many of the supply curtailments are taking place during the summer as producers anticipate continued weak pricing. 
The 767,402 tonnes producers are taking this quarter represent the most downtime producers have taken in the past fiscal year, and already has eclipsed the estimated 655,132 tonnes producers took in the second quarter. The total also dwarfed the 383,000 tonnes taken in the first quarter, when cold weather prevented some producers from shutting operations, and has surpassed the 512,000 tonnes taken in fourth-quarter 2000, when several producers combined maintenance and market-related shuts. Current downtime is primarily market related, say industry sources. 
Tembec, Inc., which has about 426,000 tonnes of yearly northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) capacity, will lose about 20,119 tonnes from its NBSK mill in Skookumchuck, B.C., while its other NBSK mill, in Smooth Rock Falls, Ont., will trim about 16,926 tonnes based on c capacity of 191,000 tonnes/yr. Tembec's NBSK downtime alone will total 37,405 tonnes, representing more than a third of the 100,000 tonnes of 3Q downtime it has planned. The remaining 62,595 tonnes will come from its various bleached chemi-thermomechanical (BCTMP) mills and some specialty sulfite pulps. 
A source at Parsons & Whittemore today said the Rye Brook, N.Y., firm would shutter its northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) mill in Nackawick, N.B., from Aug. 20 to Sept. 8. The mill, which has capacity to produce 260,000 tonnes/yr, will curb about 14,060 tonnes from its supplies. All of the downtime is market-related, said the source. 
Meanwhile, International Paper Co. said during a conference call last week that its third-quarter pulp curtailments would total about 80,000 tonnes, equaling the downtime it had taken in the second quarter. That downtime is in addition to huge cutbacks of a combined 147,000 tonnes per quarter it has taken since shutting down its integrated pulp mills in Mobile, Ala., and Camden, Ark. 
Canfor Corp. last week said it would close its Northwood mill in Prince George, B.C., from July 27-Aug. 6 and lose about 19,000 tonnes of NBSK. A company source said the mill would again close in September, with its two pulp lines shut for about 10 days each, losing another 15,000 tonnes and bringing the company's third-quarter NBSK downtime to 34,000 tonnes, according to the source. 
Valois Vision Marketing reported last week that UPM-Kymmene has taken about 12,000 tonnes of NBSK from supplies at its Miramichi, N.B., mill in July. Further third-quarter downtime plans at the firm were not available. 
"Look at the prices, I'm surprised there isn't more downtime," said Managing Director Michel Valois, who expected that paper downtime would continue at a high rate. That could fuel additional market pulp downtime moving forward, he noted.

I would appreciate your help in communicating to the HR community that signed waivers related to the revocation of job offers are to be placed in two locations:  (1) original to the vault; and (2) a copy to the application file kept by HR regarding the individual.

Thanks,

I hope you are all having a nice weekend.  With everything going on these days, I'm not sure if you have someone earmarked for taking over the responsibility for gas risk.  I would like to let you know I would like to perform that function in addition to my regular responsibilities. 
 
Thanks,

Hi Sally

Sorry for not getting back to you yesterday!

Would 8.30am this morning suit you to connect with John over the phone?

I have blocked from 2.30pm to 3.00pm in his diary for you - please let me 
know if this suits you.

Thank you.

It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.  I 
will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an 
on-going resource for operations in London.  If you are comfortable with my 
idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this 
week.  We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week.

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

Souad,

There are expiration dates for swaptions/options on the "Detail" button in 
TAGG Deal Capture.  Let's
do the following.  Go into TAGG Deal Capture and check to make sure these 
dates are valid for swaptions/options.

We will write a report that you can run that identifies deals that are  
expiring.

Thanks, Ron

We really need to raise the priority on getting this done.  We had a swaption 
with significant value to Enron not get excersied this month due to 
breakdowns in the manual process.  Let me know how extensive this will be 
from an IT perspective.  Thanks

We can implement this - the question is "when". As I indicated to Jeff, we 
are currently working on ClickPaper
but we will work on whatever is a higher priority from Enron's point of view.

Subject: TAGG modification request

Ron,

A series of significant events took place this week where it made it more 
apparent that a modification in Tagg is highly needed.   Without going into a 
lot of detail regarding the events, the modification desired is simply an 
Expiration Date field for certain types of transactions (Swaptions), where a 
date is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into TAGG.  In 
addition, this feature will permit TAGG to prompt the user or users with a 
message box of the Expiration date and associated Deal Number at a later 
time, before the expiration date becomes current (i.e. a week before the 
expiration date becomes current).  

This request carries a lot of value for it allows ENA to avoid a variety of 
risks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades.  This issue 
was addressed in the past and I would like to raise it again.

Can we implement such modification? Your prompt response is highly needed and 
your feedback is appreciated.  

Thanks. 


I work on the confirmation desk, reporting to Jeff Sorenson.  Please call me 
if you have any questions or suggestions (X37580).

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Mark, 

The pay equity issue sounds like the reviews we do every year to ensure that 
people are being paid equitably.  Given that the company has until November 
of next year to get in compliance and to report out on the compliance issue, 
it should be no big deal -- unless there currently are pay inequities.  A 
list of persons in each job, with salary and gender, could allow us to 
determine whether an issue even exists.

Michelle

Christopher -

Based upon your memo and our due diligence effort to date, is there any 
indication of (a) any steps Daishowa has taken to put the committee required 
under the Pay Equity Act or (b) any increase in compensation that would be 
consistent with the Pay Equity Act and therefore enable Daishowa to dispense 
with the need for a committee?  Is there any way to currently assess what 
potential liabilities could be or to view any industry data on this issue 
that may indicate how extensive liability could be???

The main concern is that we are negotiating with Daishowa to be in a position 
to undertake, as of closing, all responsibilities associated with all matters 
disclosed, unless there is a legal noncompliance issue (e.g., failure to 
maintain proper permits).  Since the requirements of the Pay Equity Act have 
not been identified to management as a concern, I need to ensure that this is 
a real issue (mostly from a $'s exposure standpoint) vs. something so remote 
that it should not even be discussed.

Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Just a followup to our phone call earlier this morning.   Have begun to see short-term intraday topping patterns.   Natural has reached its mid-range of price objectives.  See no rationale  for holding significant length here.  Winter months seem especially high  and most vulnerable to correction.  The first hour's negative close  produced a sell signal against today's high.  Still too early to ascertain  if this is the end of entire up move.  Have targets into early next week,  but mkt. has reached where it needed to.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Green will get one more week as the team's starter.  He will start this 
Sunday vs. New Orleans, but Kurt Warner  is expected to return for the 
December 3rd game at Carolina.  This won't be the last you've heard from 
Green.  There has been talk that he will take his services elsewhere next 
year in hopes of obtaining a starting job.  For now look for Green to put up 
big numbers against the Saints defense this week.  New Orleans has a strong 
pass rush but their corners won't be able to contain the Rams' receivers long 
enough for them to pressure Green.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 11/22/00 
 Detroit had one of the top pass rushes in the NFL last year but are 
currently among the worst garnering a mere 22 sacks.   The Lions could be 
primed for a turnaround in the final games of the season.  Detroit's pass 
rush has been much improved since the resignation of head coach Bobby Ross.  
Robert Porcher has played especially well in the last two games tallying five 
sacks and forcing a fumble.  Look for them to have a field day against the 
Patriots Sunday.  New England has allowed an astonishing 38 sacks this 
season.     

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 An MRI on Bates knee showed no structural damage and he is expected to play 
against the Patriots Thursday.  Bates has been a reliable third-down back for 
the Lions but hasn't provided much help for Fantasy teams this season.  Don't 
expect that to change when he faces the Patriots Thursday.     

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/22/00 
 Stewart was able to practice Tuesday and will play in Thursday's game 
against the Patriots.  He suffered a hip-pointer injury Sunday that forced 
him to miss Monday's practice.  Don't be surprised if Stewart struggles 
against the Patriots.  If he isn't full strength he may have a hard time 
avoiding New England's linebackers.   

 Marlon Barnes , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Barnes gained 11 yards on three carries against the Buccaneers Sunday.  
Starter James Allen will be back in the lineup once again this week after 
cutting his hand in last Sunday's game.  Barnes will resume his role as a 
third-down back.  He has played sparingly this season but could have a larger 
role in the offense next year.      

 Eddie Kennison , WR CHI - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Kennison has been a major disappointment as the Bears' second receiver this 
season catching just one touchdown pass through 11 games.  Things won't get 
any better this week when he faces a stingy Jets pass defense.  New York has 
only given up 11 passing TDs all season.  Kennison may get a few catches this 
week but don't expect him to score for your team.  At this point it would be 
wise to bench him if you haven't already.     

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Edinger has been on a roll lately making nine of his last ten field goals.  
He could have another big week against the Jets this week.  The Bears 
shouldn't have any problems moving the chains -the Jets have given up a lot 
of yards this season but have managed to keep the opposition out of the end 
zone.  New York's defense has also seen opposing offenses attempt an 
NFL-leading 28 field goals.  If Edinger can remain accurate in the swirling 
New Jersey winds, he will have a big game.     

 Bears , DT CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Look for the Bears secondary to contribute a few interceptions for your 
Fantasy team this week as Chicago faces the Jets and QB Vinny Testaverde this 
week.  Testaverde has thrown two or more interceptions in his last five 
games.  But if the Bears don't put any pressure on Testaverde and Curtis 
Martin they will rip the defense apart.  Chicago has a weak pass rush and an 
even softer run defense.    

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Hearst has been added to the 49ers' active  roster.  Head coach Steve 
Mariucci says he probably won't get into a game this season, so it wouldn't 
be wise to pick Hearst up as a free agent.  He had spent the entire year on 
the physically-unable-to-perform list after missing all of last season while 
recovering from a career-threatening ankle injury.  Keep an eye on Hearst 
though.  If his condition continues to progress he could be a sleeper pick 
next year.    

 Tony Horne , WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Horne, one of the league's best kick returners, will be out for four to six 
weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot during Monday night's game 
against Washington. He had a 24.2-yard average on kickoff returns, including 
a 103-yard touchdown. The Rams may use Az-Zahir Hakim, their punt returner, 
on kickoffs, but are more likely to sign someone.  

 Charles Kirby , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Mike Alstott now out for at least the remainder of the regular season, 
Kirby is the only remaining true fullback on the Buccaneers' roster. Still, 
he was promoted from the practice squad just two weeks ago merely to serve as 
a blocker in short-yardage situations, so don't expect him to come close to 
the 12 carries per game Alstott was averaging. Warrick Dunn will be the 
primary focus of the running game.  

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Faulk made an impressive return from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
last night against Washington, making nine catches for 88 yards and a 
touchdown while rushing for 33 yards on nine carries. He had the surgery just 
14 days prior, so the Rams were light on his rushing load, but Faulk looked 
solid in his first game back. Expect him to be close to full strength when 
the Rams play New Orleans on Sunday.  

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Steelers have activated Blackwell from the physically unable to perform 
list and placed him on their 53-man roster. He was placed on that list July 
16 after suffering a May knee injury, and is an unrestricted free agent after 
the season. Still, don't count on much, if any, Fantasy value from Blackwell. 
 

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Lions are awaiting results of an MRI performed on Bates' injured knee, 
which he sustained during Sunday's game against the Giants. He is less likely 
to play Thursday against New England than first-stringer James Stewart.  

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/21/00 
 Stewart was unable to practice with the team yesterday after suffering a hip 
pointer in Sunday's game against the Giants. With the Lions' next game coming 
Thursday against New England, there isn't much time for him to heal. Coach 
Gary Moeller thinks Stewart will be able to play through the injury. His 
status is more critical with backup Mario Bates also ailing. If neither can 
go, fullback Cory Schlesinger, running back Sedrick Irvin and special teams 
member Brock Olivo would fill in.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Despite a sprained left knee that required a brace and had him limping 
yesterday, Mitchell is still hopeful he can play Sunday against Pittsburgh. 
He is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained MCL 
during last Sunday's game against New England, but an MRI performed yesterday 
revealed no damage. If Mitchell can play, he will get the start. He'll very 
likely play if it's physically possible.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Allen will not miss practice this week 
after suffering a cut on his right hand during Sunday's game against Tampa 
Bay. He should be ready to play next Sunday against the Jets.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Shane Matthews performing well as the starter, the Bears can afford to 
be patient with McNown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder. He 
threw 15-yard passes with Matthews before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay and 
will participate in some drills tomorrow. McNown could serve as the third 
quarterback next Sunday against the Jets.   

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/21/00 
 Chandler might lose some playing time over the season's final weeks, as the 
Falcons try to evaluate rookie Doug Johnson for their future. This isn't a 
condemnation of the veteran Chandler, but his owners should make sure he's 
going to start each week before giving him the nod.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Falcons might consider giving Johnson some playing time over the 
season's final weeks, as the team decides whether he can serve as the QB of 
the future or if one will need to be taken in next year's draft. If he is 
given a shot, those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his 
performance.  

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for Sunday's game against Cleveland. With 
Baltimore's bye week coming up after that, he will get an extra week to rest, 
and should be ready to roll against San Diego in Week 15.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 The Eagles' signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes.  He 
completed 25-of-34 passes for 217 yards and accounted for two touchdowns in 
Sunday's win over Arizona.  He will need to keep his composure next week 
against the Redskins, as the two teams battle for first place in the NFC 
East.  The Eagles will need a huge performance from McNabb if they are to 
beat Washington, so give him a start this week in the big game.    

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Connell caught five passes for 96 yards in Monday night's win over the 
Rams.  Washington will face a tough Eagles' secondary next week, which will 
be looking to keep their team in first place in the NFC East.  If the 'Skins 
can establish their running game early, Connell could have a big game.      

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/00 
 George was very impressive in Monday night's big win over St. Louis.  He 
completed 24-of-34 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns against the 
Rams, further clouding the quarterback situation in Washington.  Starter Brad 
Johnson should know by Thursday if he is able to play next week against the  
Eagles, so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of 
these players on your roster.    

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis accounted for 106 yards of total offense but didn't score a touchdown 
as Washington defeated St. Louis 33-20 on Monday night. It was the first time 
in seven weeks that Davis had been held out of the end zone. Look for the 
'Skins to establish Davis early in the game next week against the Eagles in 
an effort to open up their passing game.     

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  "We'll see Wednesday or Thursday," said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, "but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play."    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.

Sally - just an fyi...  Jeff Hodge requested that we send him the information 
below.  Evidently, the FERC has requested that several US wholesale companies 
provide a great deal of information to them due to the volatility of natural 
gas prices the past few weeks (it is being driven by the California 
markets).  Legal got them agree to simply giving them a weighted average 
price of gas on the 11th for delivery on the 12th.  It worked out as $24.47 
for buys and $18.14 for sales.  This is US physical next day only.

STOCKHOLM, Aug. 22, 2001 (Reuters) - Finnish-Swedish Stora Enso and International Paper are in talks on the world's largest forest industry merger, Swedish daily Dagens Industri reported on Wednesday. 
If the companies were to merge, they would create a forest industry giant with annual sales of more than SEK 400 billion ($38.68 billion). IP is the world's largest papermaker in terms of output and Stora Enso is number two. Dagens Industri said it was basing its reports on sources which it did not identify. 
Officials at Stora Enso were not immediately available for comment. Were a merger to take place, it would create a dominant sector player with a market capitalization of some $30 billion, according to data from Reuters Securities 3000. 
Consolidation has picked up in the forest industry over the past few years as firms try to counter cyclical trends and the slowing global economy. Stora Enso bought US Consolidated Paper in 2000 to vault the firm into number two globally, while sector leader IP bought US Champion International also last year after winning a bidding war with Finnish UPM-Kymmene . 
IP shares ended flat at $41.04 overnight, while Stora Enso shares in Helsinki slipped slightly to Euro 12.32 ($11.29).

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Larry,

I received this email message from Leslie this afternoon... she asked if I
had received the letter from her that approved TW's request to discontinue
the groundwater monitoring at the Puckett site.

She may have asked this because she may have expected to receive an annual
report last week.

Last week, I sent to you a draft of what I thought should go into the new
annual reports, now that we don't have any groundwater monitoring to report.

Please let me know if you want me to send an annual report to her.

Later,
James

The companies that are our primary competition in this area are the Big 5 
accounting firms.  They interview in May of a 5 year PPA's 3rd year for a 
Spring Internship in the 4th year.  We must attract 4th year PPAs in the fall 
before their spring internship or 3rd year PPAs in the spring.  We need to do 
alot more planning on this between now and next fall but I definitely want to 
interview for interns both in the spring and fall.  Thanks

Lynett and Cindy:

Greetings from Houston!

I have a special request for you.  In order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall, I need information regarding
internship
recruiting.

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of
particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting
firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.

By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Lexi Elliott

On November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue to match union employees' contributions to the Plan.

?	Diversification within the Plan will now be allowed, regardless of your age, from ALL company contribution accounts.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  Effective immediately, you can invest these amounts in the fund or funds of your choosing.

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

Subject: Re: Notice of Pending Changes (effective 12/18/2000) to MAPP's Loss 
Repayment Procedure  

I called MAPP to get a better understanding of the pending Dec. 18th LRP 
changes as explained in detail below.
Currently the "source" generator is responsible for the Losses.  The new 
policy states that the Scheduling customer is now responsible for Losses.  
MAPP is implementing this change as a requirement under their tariff.  
Changes to software and systems has delayed this change from being 
implemented any earlier.
What it means to Enron as a Schedule F customer:
 1)  Enron (or any Schedule F customer) is responsible for  losses based on a 
yet to be published Loss Matrix that MAPP will provide on it web page.  The 
loss  calculation matrix and methodolgy will not change, just the party 
responsible for providing the losses.  When scheduling energy, Enron must  
either schedule physical losses or buy losses from a designated Source 
Scheduling participant (SSP).  The SSP will then be responsible for 
disbursing the losses to each designated CA a week later.
The identity of the SSP will be the Source of power (if a MAPP member), or 
the POR on your Schedule F (If Source is outside MAPP).

Repayment Procedure


Notice of new MAPP Loss Repayment Policies and Procedures

At the direction of the Regional Transmission Committee of MAPP, new Loss
Repayment Policies and Procedures will be implemented on December 18, 2000.
These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the OASIS
reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on MAPP Schedule F
transmission service.  Previously, the MAPP Source entity has been
responsible for paying these losses.  These changes do not modify the
application of MAPP's Loss Repayment Procedure (LRP) to MAPP Member Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) customers.  Changes to the administration
of Schedule F loss repayment include:
o The Schedule F transmission customer will now be responsible for the LRP
losses on their energy schedules.
o Payment of third party impacts due to "through flowing" Schedule F
transactions (where the Source and Sink are both outside MAPP) will be
included in the LRP.
o To facilitate the payment of third party losses, the Customer will make
arrangements with the Source Scheduling Participant (SSP), as defined on the
transmission reservation, to pay for energy transaction losses at the onset
of a schedule.
o The SSP will bank the losses for repayment of third party losses, one week
later, to the day. The repayment is done, as it is today, according to a
schedule sent out by the MAPP Center.
For additional information please see the business practices section of
MAPP's Schedule F OASIS:
http://mapp.oasis.mapp.org/documents/MAPP/practices.html

Questions may be e-mailed to Tom White at the MAPP Center:
ts.white@mapp.org

Answers to frequently asked questions will be posted at the URL given above.

A copy of the revised section five of the policies and procedures document
is attached.

        Chris, I only got info on the Mid Am Oct. charts.  I talked to Gary again yesterday and 
        ask for more information.  Hopefully I'll have something today.  Have you already 
        sent your letter to Alliant?  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, any update yet from Gary or Caroline as to the updates you requested in your December 11 email?  I am finalizing a letter to Alliant and would like to provide them with an expectation as to the October PPA's.  Specifically, will all the October charts be corrected?

Further, Alliant wants Gas Logistics to tag the PPA's.  Specifically, Alliant requested the differences are identified by gate and amount of change.  Is this possible?

send this to one person at a time to ensure all names get added to same list and @ 500 it can start over with another and another until the government gets the message. PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION BELOW AND PASS THIS ON UNTIL THERE ARE 500 NAMES THEN SEND TO: President@whitehouse.gov <mailto:President@whitehouse.gov> 

Dear President Bush: Many of us were deeply touched to hear you recite a portion of Psalm 23 in your address to this great nation in the dark hours following the terrorists attacks. We were encouraged and comforted to know that we truly had a believer working with us and for us in our nation's highest office. We the people of America are requesting that you lift the prohibition of prayer in schools. As the pledge of our great country states, we are to be "One nation, under God." Please allow the prayers and petitions of our children in schools without the threat of punishment.Currently, adults and children in the schools are prohibited from mentioning God unless of course His name is uttered as part of a curse or profanity. Madeline Murray O'Hare is dead. Let her legacy of atheism in our schools die with her!             &nb! sp; Sincerely,  The People of America 

Mark 10:13-14 "People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."

Ricki, it might be quicker to re-create the timeline.  I can give you a colored copy so you
can keep it identical to the one we have.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn I have a few hard copies of the old ET&S timeline that I created in 98.  I remember I was on vacation when I created it because Donna was faxing changes to my house.  Wish me luck trying to find it in that mess, everything is in boxes.  I know it's on a diskette somewhere, so please bear with me.  If I can't find it, should I recreate it, and if so, are there any changes.

Thanks,
Ricki

Depending on others' schedules, Feb. 23 is good for me.  I will be out of the

Subject: NABA photo shoot


EES and Sally Beck's organization in EWS are joining forces to underwrite
Enron's recruiting presence at the 30th Annual National Association of
Black Accountants National Conference and Job Fair this August in Dallas,
Texas.  NABA is an professional organization of 100,000 African Americans
in the fields of accounting, finance, consulting and IT.

We are planning a photo shoot of a check presentation to the Executive
Director of NABA, who is making a special trip to Houston for this purpose.
The photo and caption will appear in the pre-conference NABA newsletter to
its members (not a paid advertisement).  We would like to have Cindy,
Sally, Wes, Ted and the representative from EES in the photo, if possible.
We also need to decide whose signature should appear on the mocked up check
for the photo - what do you think?

We are checking on dates for the shoot now, and Debbie Nowak will be
contacting you/your assistants to check for your availability.  (likely
contenders are Feb 23 around mid-day and March 2)

We are excited about Enron's participation in this conference and look
forward to some great hires.

Thanks,

Gwynn

ENW EBS IT -  Weekly Status Report  (as of 10/26/01)


Executive Summary :

EnFiber:   Real Estate Book requirements gathering and documentation is 100=
% complete; obtained all approvals; development is 25% complete.  User acce=
ptance testing for Scheduling Phase 1 is 85% complete; the implementation d=
ate has been changed to 10/26 per user's request.  Waiting for final signof=
f from Jim Terrell. Successfully implemented FACT Release 1.2 on 10/15.  Co=
mpleted development of IP and Local Loop options for Valuation and began QA=
 testing. =20

PPCS/TRPS:=20
TRP demo by Dorado is well accepted by Enron audience. The prototype is abl=
e to fix the biggest problem in the current EBS bandwidth trading process -=
- not able to show the actual hardware inventory of network elements in ord=
er to make accurate port striping and cross connect. Through their auto har=
dware discovery device driver, switch inventory will be presented clearly t=
o the users in a nice graphical layout, so provisioners don't have to spend=
 huge amount of time to maintain various IT systems to gather the knowledge=
 of bandwidth capacity allocation.  TRPS will gather information for both T=
DM and IP.
Settlements (Saber):  Users are approximately 50% complete with User Accept=
ance Testing.  Users were successful in posting first invoices to SAP with =
no errors.  A demo of the GUI for the Flash to Actuals reconciliation proce=
ss is scheduled for Monday, Oct. 29.  Production Implementation will be mid=
-to-late November,  a couple weeks ahead of original schedule.   =20
Remedy:  Started discussions for release 2.0 of the EBS Change Management a=
pplication.   Changes to include schedule maintenance notices and test & tu=
rnup.  These changes does not require mandatory approval. Added automatic r=
eporting functionality to the EBS Trouble Ticketing system.  Continued web =
development on the MSN document routing and approval system.   Functionalit=
ies completed include submitting new request, approvals and comments.
Livelink thespotlight: is currently providing storage for 24606 documents. =
Currently work is in progress to incorporate Engineering and Operations doc=
uments into the system, as well as migrate the system into the Corp domain.=
 Below is a more detailed description of this week's activities and next we=
ek's deliverables.
 EBS Application Infrastructure:  Provide oversight and project management =
activities of the EBS application infrastructure with ENW.

EBS Database Technologies:   Provide on-going production and development da=
tabase support for both external and internal EBS database systems.

Utopia: The proof of concept was completed Sept. 21st. A demo has now been =
given to Rick Paiste, Inja Chun, Rick Fehl, Paul Racicot and Sue Klinke, al=
l reactions were favorable. The next steps will be to refine the presentati=
on and re-present to upper management for further approval. Al Nahas will b=
e demoed the product next week. We have identified issues with several of t=
he dBs and this would require additional work to correct these data problem=
s between the systems, this will not be an insignificant task.

Voice Minutes Trading:  USTeleNet has agreed to accept Enron routing data v=
ia an automated exchange (XML format) as opposed to the current labor-inten=
sive process..  This will require USTeleNet to develop an interface to thei=
r TMS system.  We are also working with Nortel to interface with their Nort=
el switch via software (i.e. API).  Nortel has a proprietary DMS 250/300 op=
erating system which requires manual input every time a route is changed;  =
we will continue to investigate the feasibility of interfacing internally-d=
eveloped software to improve efficiencies & accuracies.  Many suppliers' ra=
tes have been downloaded to our environment for purpose of finding least-co=
st supplier's rates for our traders and creation of rate sheets for confirm=
ation.  New Product Management and Supplier Rate Management modules have be=
en developed and are now being tested by users.  Trader Ratesheet developme=
nt should be completed & available for testing within the week.     We have=
 scheduled 11/8 & 11/9 for the 4tel / Telesciences software demo.     =20
Deal Prospects / Contact Tracking:  Reviewed options including existing sol=
utions such as EnGAGE, Siebel (off-the-shelf) and an internally developed w=
eb-based tool.  Goal is to provide a simple, cost-effective tool that can b=
e used by commercial teams (starting with Mid-Market, DRAM, Minutes ?) to t=
rack prospects & contacts.   =20
Enron  kicked off an enterprise-wide CRM initiative with the goal of recomm=
ending a CRM strategy (including Sales Force Automation) to senior Enron ma=
nagement by October 25.   EBS will only be participating in the assessment =
/ evaluation stage.=20
Media Services / Strata:  Developed a Tactical Deal Capture product ; in pr=
ocess of completing Sales Invoice functionality for Tactical Settlements, i=
ncluding the ability to generate Sales Invoices on the basis of Physical Sp=
ots, Survey-Based GRPs, Overnight-Based GRPs, or PreBill (prior to actual s=
pot airing).  Tactical Deal + Settlements are integrated, using Strata core=
 data coupled with Tactical Deal data.   Continued systematic daily process=
ing of Nielsen Overnight TV & Cable Ratings data (nearly 100,000 lines/day)=
, along with systematic aggregation of Quarter Hour data for each TV progra=
m.   Created Buy Statistics & Market Statistics UI against existing Strata =
data.  =20
EBS Contracts (tactical): Continued development of v5.2.  This release incl=
udes enhancements to add attributes for Minutes contracts.  The scheduled r=
elease date is 11/06.
EBS Contracts (strategic): Completed updating project plans and will provid=
e to business next week.  Completed database modeling for tasks and reminde=
rs.  Began development of client-side (browser) validation for commercial c=
ontracts.
EBS Facilities:  Continued development of v3.3.  This release will include =
the ability to query key systems for their dependency on Facilities and aut=
omation of the short description.
Global Counterparty/Common Codes:  Corrected problems with wire information=
 and address roles that were identified during Saber/Globals testing.

I have confirmed that the following invoices for Williams Production RMT Company ("Williams"), were sent under ENA's Demand Letter dated March 1, 2002:

			Invoice Nos. 	020168809

Please note, the only Invoice not included with ENA's Demand Letter to Williams was:   0203094.  Therefore, advise as to whether this invoice also relates to Williams and why it was not included with ENA's letter of March 1st.

Further, please advise if the $7,686.87 interest check relates to all the invoices, including Invoice #0203094.

Sharon, Kriste, and I discussed this, and agreed that simple was better.  We 
also thought that a reference to the Enron Employee Data Protection Policy 
and the Code of Ethics provisions on data should be referenced, with a link, 
if possible.  Thanks. Michelle

If we place this on every page, I'd recommend we keep it simple and clear as 
is below.  

If we need to establish an accept/decline box I'd recommend we build it so 
the user only has to accept once, after which an intranet cookie would 
remember that the user accepted and wouldn't burden the user with the 
question each and every time.

Dear all, 

We are about to embark on opening up more Enron people data to the general 
Enron population (i.e. expertfinder).  I want to ensure the appropriate risks 
have been identified, documented and agreed upon by the Enron executive 
staff.  Michelle mentioned last week that we may want to consider putting 
some proprietary statement on our applications that house people data. 
Therefore, I would like to have an agreed upon statement that can be posted 
in our applications. 
Here's one to get you started.  I would like to have this finalized by 
Tuesday September 25th.  Thanks. ay

Michelle;
I have been working quite closely with Valeria these past few weeks on many difficult HR issues.  I wanted to let you know, that she is wonderful to work with.  Her calm, professional demeanor is a real asset in these times.  

Valeria has a difficult, but critical role here at Enron.  I consider her a true partner to my generalist duties.

Thanks
Judy

Hey Tom and Sally,
 I just wanted to give a status report of my meeting with Louise Kitchen 
yesterday. Four main issues were of Confirm Central were discussed: legal 
loose ends and ramifications, user interface, functionality, and future 
enhancements.

 Starting with the legal aspect Louise wanted Mark Taylor brought into the 
process. She felt his experience from EOL would be useful, and would help 
make any seams between EOL and CL disappear. I am setting up ameeting for 
early next week between Mark T., Mark G., and Alan to get this process 
rolling.
 
 The user interface Louise thought needed some work she definitely did not 
like the colors of the website. She had good comments on how to improve the 
look and feel. We will try to incorporate Louise's suggestions as quickly as 
possible. I am not to concerned about these comments since we have spent the 
last 4 weeks developing functionality and have not yet focused on this issue.

 Louise was happy with the actual functionality of the site. She actually 
said we did an excellent job.
 
 Finally, on future relases she wanted us to focus on Financial & Physical 
Power, Financial & Physiacl Gas in the U.S. She felt that this is a market 
where we could make money, where Enron has enough volume that we could really 
relieve some pain on our counterparties. Other commodities such as Liquids, 
Global Products, Metals, she felt either did not have enough voume to justify 
the business model or would take to long to integrate into CL. As far as 
additional features to the site incorpoating an importing function for CP 
data was high on the list, next was reporting confirmation statistics, 
exporting data, and finally automatching.

Take away message from the meeting was that Louise was extremely happy with 
the site and our progress to date.

Brad

George,

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Phillip

Rick,
 
I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and portfolio.  I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal.  I have also reviewed them with Vlady .
 
1.  VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.
 
2. NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR I've recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.
 
If you agree with these changes please let me know.  If you have any questions please contact me at (503) 464-2723.
 
Thanks.

Sally,

I hope that things went well in Calgary.  I am rapping things up here and I 
cannot wait to return home.  

My tentative meeting with Joe Gold for this afternoon has been rescheduled 
for 9:00 this morning.  Attached is my assessment of the Continental Power 
operations which I intend to discuss with him.  The first page is for Joe in 
case he would like to keep notes from our discussion and the second page is 
more detailed for myself.  Joe asked that he and I meet privately to discuss 
the operations.  I've tried to be candid, but yet politically correct.

Today I am having lunch with Fernly and meeting with the Weather Commercial 
team at 4:00.

I'll phone to give you an update,
Todd

Attached is an article from Reuters. It illustrates the true vulnerability of our information if left unprotected, and demonstrates how one attack can cause a variety of different issues.
Please recognize possible exposures you face on your personal home computer. Ensure that you are taking precautions. The following are some common sense rules you can follow:
?	Use an anti-virus program such as Symantec's Norton Anti Virus (NAV) or McAfee's VirusScan and update virus data files regularly.
?    Use Windows Update regularly. Microsoft offers updates to its software that fix security issues on your computer's operating system.
?    Consider a firewall program such as Netice's Black Ice or Zone Lab's Zone Alarm. These offer protection from people doing online probing of your equipment while you're on the internet.
Remember, "An ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure".  Nothing can guarantee one hundred percent protection but this will get you headed in the right direction.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions or concerns.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Internet worm that leaves infected computers vulnerable to future hacking by tracking what is typed on the keyboard, including passwords and credit card details, was spreading rapidly on Monday, computer security companies warned. 
The worm, called ``Badtrans,'' spreads through Microsoft Corp. Outlook or Outlook Express e-mail programs and automatically sends itself to unanswered e-mails in inboxes, according to several antivirus companies. 
The attachment, which contains the malicious program, can be executed simply by reading or previewing it and doesn't need to be double clicked or opened separately, experts said. 
The worm contains a keystroke logger, which can be used to record what people type to obtain passwords and credit card numbers, they said. 
``It does no damage to files but does drop a backdoor trojan on the machine which would allow a hacker to come back and access personal information,'' said April Goostree, virus research manager at McAfee. 
While corporate e-mail gateways are blocking the worm, many home and small office computer users who aren't up-to-date on their antivirus software are getting infected, she said. 
The subject line varies, often assuming the text of the unanswered e-mail whose e-mail address it co-opts. The name of the attachment varies as well, with suffixes including .doc,. pics, and. news. 
The worm, a variant of one discovered in April, has hit at least 50 countries, with most infections in Germany, followed by the UK and United States, said UK-based MessageLabs, which reported receiving 400 copies an hour this weekend.

  Market Participants:
  The CAISO has posted its draft Congestion Management Reform
(CMR) recommendation on its web site at
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html
<http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html> . This document
recommends changes to the CAISO's current Congestion Management process and
related features of its business practices and operations. This is a draft
document, albeit one that we believe reflects significant effort and thought
on the part of both the stakeholders who provided the initial input and the
interdisciplinary design team that drafted this document.
  This CMR recommendation represents an essential milestone in
the broader Congestion Management Reform Project.  The first stage involved
soliciting stakeholder input regarding the problems to be solved,
alternative solutions to address these problems, and criteria for evaluating
reform proposals. The second stage involved the CAISO's crafting an
integrated, internally consistent reform package utilizing the ideas
developed with and/or by Stakeholders in stage one. This document contains
the CAISO's draft recommendation. We emphasize that, although we believe
this recommendation package to be a necessary milestone in the Congestion
Management Reform Project, it is not intended to predispose the final
design. We are actively soliciting Stakeholders' comments and critiques
concerning this recommendation over the coming weeks (stage three of the CMR
project).
  Once the next round of stakeholder input has been assessed,
the CAISO will revise this CMR recommendation. The revised recommendation
will be presented to the CAISO Governing Board for discussion and review
only on August 1 (no Board action requested). The CMR recommendation will
continue to be developed through August and the final recommendation will be
submitted to the CAISO Governing Board for approval at the September 6th and
7th meeting.  The approved CMR recommendation will be prepared (in
conjunction with Stakeholders) for the final Tariff filing to FERC in
November (stage four). A revised, detailed calendar will be presented at the
CMR Stakeholder meetings on July 13 and 14.
  At the July 13 and 14 Stakeholder meetings, the CAISO will
present the entire recommendation, section-by-section and provide the
opportunity for Stakeholders to clarify their understanding of what is being
proposed. Shortly thereafter, we will hold additional Stakeholder meetings
to facilitate detailed discussion of individual elements of the
recommendation. Additional meeting dates will be discussed on July 14 at the
meeting.
  We look forward to reviewing this proposal with you and
receiving your comments. The CAISO welcomes any and all comments and
critiques of this recommendation. We appreciate your attention and efforts

 Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon=

 bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn=

 when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it wo=

f Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilf=

on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Ha=

eahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to=
 the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in fo=
r Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very fav=
orable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him =
this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01   =
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Caro=
lina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concuss=

ent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. =
He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy=

 He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use =
him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/23/01 =
  Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead =
of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend=
 you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hard=

serve WR Updated 10/24/01  The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured rese=
rve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his =
season.    Rob Moore  , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01  According to Cardinals=
 coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season game this season.=
 Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have set=
backs in his recovery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the=
 Arizona Republic . "That's why we both handled it like we did in training =
camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't=
 tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, =
we won't have him." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the ti=
me to let him go.    Freddie Jones  , Active TE Updated 10/22/01  Jones spr=
ained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.    Michae=
l Pittman  , Active RB Updated 10/21/01  Pittman had a great outing on Sund=
ay against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown.=
 Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a=
 valuable player to have on your roster.    LaDainian Tomlinson  , Active R=
B Updated 10/21/01  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this sea=
son by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on th=
e day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.    Ahma=
n Green  , Reserve RB Updated 10/19/01  Green will get the bulk of his numb=
ers in the second half if Green Bay can get ahead of Minnesota early. He wi=
ll definitely be good for at least one TD.    Shannon Sharpe  , Active TE U=
pdated 10/19/01  Expect Sharpe to have another solid week, as far as tight =
ends are concerned. He is the team's leader in receptions and should get a =
reasonable amount of balls thrown his way. Don't be surprised if he scores =
a touchdown as well. Sharpe is overdue for a score. He had five TD catches =
in 2000 but hasn't scored one this season.    Kurt Warner  , Active QB Upda=
ted 10/18/01  Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis=
, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against =
the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.    Torry Ho=
lt  , Active WR Updated 10/18/01  Holt has the potential to post big number=
s against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wi=
deout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.    Mark Brun=
ell  , Reserve QB Updated 10/17/01  Brunell is no longer being bothered by =
headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for ov=
er 200 yards and a score.    Vikings  , Reserve DT Updated 09/26/01  The Vi=
kings signed former Buffalo safety Henry Jones this week. He'll replace Rob=
ert Griffith, who broke his leg during Sunday's game against Chicago. The m=
ove won't make Minnesota's secondary much better than it was, however, and =
doesn't improve the unit overall from a Fantasy perspective.    Steve Chris=
tie  , Reserve K Updated 09/11/01  According to published reports, Christie=
 has been released by the Buffalo Bills. Christie, who was placed on injure=
d reserve due to a groin injury last week, will have an MRI on Tuesday. Dro=
p Christie now if you haven't already done so, and consider picking up Jake=
 Arians, who has taken over the placekicking duties in Buffalo.    Travis P=
rentice  , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01  Prentice was traded to the Vikings,=
 where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a Fant=

Gentlemen:
?
We look forward to getting your Nov. 10 hourly  deals. If you would, please 
set up an email list with:
?
bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com
ellen.clardy@ipgdirect.com??  Phone # is 713/647-6603
suzanna.strangmeier.@ipgdirect.com?  Phone # is 713/647-7325
tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com?  (The latter is our shared, group email  
address.)
?
Thanks so much for your cooperation and rest  assured, we're endeavoring to 
get the Cin index out by 9:15 a.m. each weekday.  Is that the optimum time, 
getting the index out after options  expire?
?
This will take some time, getting people to  cooperate, but we will prevail.
?
Also, please note we're collecting historicals for  ComEd, TVA and SPP, if 
you want to include those deals (no indicative necessary  at this time).
?
Thanks, guys! As always, call if we can be of  assistance--

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

UPDATE ON GRAEME WHITE

We are pleased to be able to give you a progress report on the condition of Graeme White who was injured in Wednesday's explosion at Teesside Power Station.  Graeme has now been moved from the Intensive Care Unit at Middlesbrough General Hospital to Ward 46 - a specialised skincare unit - where he is receiving treatment for burns.  He has been able to open his eyes now and is taking food.  His condition is still described as "stable".

Please don't send flowers, but cards and messages for Graeme will be welcome.  They should be sent to the address below or c/o Julie Webster at Enron's Stockton office who will ensure they are promptly delivered.

Graeme was visited last night by Jeff Skilling and Brian Stanley and they also met members of his family.  Other colleagues planning a visit should contact Julie Webster (+44 1642 623004) or Graham Moore (+44 1642 442133) who are coordinating the program.

Dear Sally,

Attached is the latest version of the summary.  It is complete, but I'm still 
waiting for Scott E to let me know if anything has been done in Panama.

You mentioned yesterday that you wanted the offices rated.  I have put a 
rating in, based on the number comments, size of the office, and severity of 
the comments, and what I understand the general attitude of the office to be, 
but you should probably take a look at it since you attended some of these 
reviews.

Best regards

Shona

For the May 8th expanded staff meeting, I would like to include Kevin Heal 
(Lead, Logistics) and Dianne Seib (Sr. Specialist, Documentation) as well as 
Kathy Reeves who is currently my only direct report at the manager level.  
Kevin and Dianne provide a lot of leadership to their respective groups, and 
I think it would be very useful for them to hear what Beth has to say.  Do 
you think this will cause a problem given that you are restricting the 
Houston attendance?  Let me know your thoughts.

For the PRC meeting, I am currently planning to be in Houston June 15th and 
16th for the Global conference.  The best dates for me would be Tuesday, June 
13th or  Wednesday, June 14th, and I'll just come to Houston earlier than 
planned.  Let me know once you've finalized the date.

For the training, there are only three people in Energy Operations doing 
reviews.  The three are Kevin Heal, Kathy Reeves and me.  I don't know 
Norma's last name so would you mind forwarding this list to her.  I will talk 
to Dawn Doucet about the best way to coordinate the training.

Let me know if you have questions.

Subject:=09Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from indu=
strials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The industr=
ial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subje=
ct to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the=
 industrials).=20

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used prim=
arily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" subje=
ct to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell pow=
er at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice u=
nder section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing=
). =20
=09 -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; =
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requireme=
nts for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they ar=
e selling at wholesale.
=09-- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the in=
dustrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of th=
e industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from eac=
h seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  Accounting/c=
ommercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are fla=
gged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our b=
ig quarterly reports.
=09-- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any=
 rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industri=
al to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless o=
therwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week t=
o purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to pu=
rchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order indica=
tes, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 2001=
.

This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.

Thank You,

Larry May

Frank,

I just completed a phone conversation with Mr. Jeffrey M. Tanenbaum, Council 
with Littler Mendelson, that you retained to review our ergonomics written 
programs and plan for Grandfathering Enron companies. Mr. Tanenbaum appears 
to be an excellent choice for this assignment due to his being full time in 
the area of OSHA compliance and his business reputation. 

I explained in full Enron's position with respect to the existence of written 
ergo program procedures as of November 14, 2000 and my actions and plan to 
obtain Grandfathering status by January 16, 2001. Mr. Tanenbaum stated he 
finds no problem with the plan to achieve this status. He indicated that his 
review of the programs should stand for the evaluation of the program 
elements, and agreed that the OSHA 200 Log review would cover the remainder 
of the evaluation requirement, but suggested this be done under Attorney 
Client privilege with him. 

He has some minor, to use his words, rework of the programs he will be 
forwarding to us. These revisions will need to be integrated into the written 
programs before January 16, 2001.

I most appreciate your attention to this matter and the timeliness in 
obtaining us a review of our action plan and programs.

Regards,

Russ

Wanted to let you know that the monthly AR file which Jerry keeps up and the analysis of timing of when we receive payments has helped us tremendously with our Cash Flow forecasting.  This is a tool we are using throughout the month.

JD,

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements
	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  

My contacts at CG&E have been Paul Jett  (513) 287-1770 and Steve Averbeck (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Gloria Ogenyi x 58202.  

Thanks, 
Jeff

I talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control to see why we had such a difference in the PVR Shrink for the 26th.  He is showing the volume for the PVR measured @ 96.7 which would be only a 2,481 difference and make the monthly only 4,654 difference.  I also went out into PGAS and confirmed the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth.  Apparently we have an issue between PGAS and the TMS system.

I will get with Harry, the PGAS group, and the TMS in the morning to see if we can figure out what is going on.  So please disregard the Bushton Report for the 26th.

Dwayne and Gary,

At the request of Brian Redmond, I have prepared and am forwarding to you a 
draft of an Amendment to the Purchase and Sale Agreement that will reflect 
the agreement that the HPL Bank Accounts will be retained by Enron after the 
closing and that AEP will set up its own new HPL accounts at its preferred 
banks after closing.   It is my understanding from Mary Perkins of Enron that 
the procedures set out in the amendment were agreed to by Jana Soward of 
AEP.    Please review the enclosed and let me know if you have any 
comments.    We would like to get this one issue resolved and out of the way 
as soon as possible.  Thanks and hope you both are doing well.

THE FRIDAY BURRITO
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."

There is a hint of Autumn in the air.  I don=0F't know if it=0F's wishful
thinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale
summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.  It=0F's premature, I know.  A few
fallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows
... I=0F'm jumping the gun.  I can=0F't wait for this summer to be over,
especially this summer.  The pounding never stops, and as I hear the din
of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature, I
can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up: fires in
Montana restricting transmission paths, blown up interstate gas pipeline
in New Mexico, diminishing N-Ox credits for in-state power plants,
depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for
commercial and industrial customers, credit limits restricting imports
of Canadian power into the Northwest and California, and BPA buying
about 1,000 MW to cover its short hydro position.

 I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the
California restructured power industry.  I just want to end to the
summer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even in
Cleveland.

There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect of
the wholesale power market out here.  Two days ago there were only six,
but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=0F's
request.  That means FERC has two, the PUC has two, the State Attorneys
General has two (one on the ISO Governing Board, and one on the in-state
generators), and one by the Electric Oversight Board.  If you don=0F't have
an ongoing study of the California Market, then you=0F're not hip.

All of these investigations, save FERC=0F's Section 206 Investigation, are
going to amount to near nothing.  A lot of wasted time and paper.  The
PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.  Now
they need some evidence to support their assertions.

And how are we holding up under all of this?  How are you doing?  I talk
to many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.
I share your frustration.  You want to tell the public, the press, and
anyone in between the truth.  You want to lay out the facts.  You want
to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is
making things worse, not better.  The price caps, for example, are
damnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of those
people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price
shocks.  Now they are receiving higher average prices.

The public isn=0F't going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.
And let=0F's face it, when it comes to stellar public relations, our
industry is not known for turning in A+ performances, except for SCE.
Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every
turn.  I heard SCE is putting on their customers=0F' bill, =0F"Here is what
you would have paid if the rate freeze ended ....=0F".  But many of us in
the new power industry, borne from the loins of either the natural-gas
industry or nuclear-power business, learned the hard way that the best
response to a public inquiry is a two-block head start in front of an
angry mob.  Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shall
pass.

I don=0F't buy that approach, at least not anymore.  That is, I don=0F't
believe we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.  What
electric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public,
and in everyone=0F's best interests.  Look at it this way, when they pat
the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do you
most want to be remembered?  That you caved in to the political will of
others, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was right
instead of what was expedient?  I think the choice is easy, albeit laced
with sheer terror.  Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids
(e.g., tell the truth, do what is right, think of the big picture and
not just yourself) are a lot easier to speak than to live by.  So join
me and stand up for what you believe.  They can=0F't take away your pride,
not yet.

Here is this week=0F's line up.

 @@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F's Order on SDG&E Complaint

President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San
Diego, retired, fixed-income, likely to vote for a Democrat, are making
choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes.  I call
this the Del Monica Beach lecture.  The Prez instructed the FERC to
investigate the situation in California, and FERC wasted no time.

In response to SDG&E=0F's August 2 complaint, whereby the utility asked
FERC to impose a $250 price cap on generators in the region, the FERC
responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago.  The
FERC slammed SDG&E on their complaint for lack of merit, and the FERC
also initiated an FPA Section 206 Investigation into the wholesale power
market in California.

Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERC=0F's Order:

=0F"In this order, ... , we are denying SDG&E's requested immediate
imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California.  However, we are
instituting consolidated hearing   proceedings pursuant to section 206
of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness
of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and
ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX, and to also
investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws
of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient
operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California
and need to be modified

=0F"SDG&E concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if
sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that
would prevail in open competition, i.e., sellers are able to bid and
receive prices significantly above their marginal costs.  SDG&E also
argues that the hour-to-hour volatility in imbalance energy prices and
the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that
the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed.

=0F"While we find it appropriate to institute a section 206 hearing on
these issues, we cannot implement an immediate price cap of $250/MWh as
requested by SDG&E because there is no record before us to support such
an action.  ...  While the issues raised by this complaint are
important, the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDG&E's proposal
to place an immediate, arbitrary $250/MWh cap on the price that every
public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the
PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard.  SDG&E has provided no
evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise
market power, has not documented a single instance of a seller
exercising market power during times of scarcity, and did not attempt to
show that the conditions underlying the Commission's approval of
market-based rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary
services have changed.  Nor did it address specific market or
institutional  factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or
unreasonable.

=0F"SDG&E asserts that the ISO's congestion management and market
structures are flawed and in need of overhaul. ... Furthermore, SDG&E
expresses its concern that, for a number of reasons, the congestion
management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders
will not produce  meaningful results.  SDG&E indicates that it is
prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals;
however, SDG&E's complains that the ISO stakeholder process has, in
SDG&E's judgment, been ineffective with respect to these issues.

=0F"Various interveners contend that SDG&E's arguments are premature. ...
We agree with Interveners. ...  The reform efforts have been the subject
of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion.
Accordingly, we reject SDG&E's arguments at this time.

=0F"It is unclear whether SDG&E's failure to purchase hedging instruments
for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its
business decisions.  A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the
volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary, particularly when
consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price
signals.

=0F"We are concerned that ... increasing level of market activity in the
real-time market raises significant reliability and economical concerns.
...  Historically, the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources
needed for the operating day.  Not only does this procurement practice
put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last
minute, but the practice is uneconomical.  Such spot-market purchases
are not subject to the ISO's  buyer's cap.  Furthermore, because the ISO
is the supplier of last resort for these services, when OOM calls are
made, suppliers realize that the ISO is in a must-buy situation.

=0F"In an effort to address this problem, we direct the ISO to immediately
institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary
to reliably operate the grid.  Specifically, the ISO should anticipate
the need for such additional resources based on  forecasted peak
periods.  We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of
the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this
analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price
cap authority.=0F"

In closing, WPTF is an intervenor in the case, and we hope to be very
active in the case through testimony, cross examination, the filing of
briefs, and reply briefs.

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy Product

Several weeks ago, I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing
a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the
morning of a trade day, and be dispatched during the super-peak hours.
I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market
instead of the ISO doing the same.

At the August 1 ISO Governing Board meeting, I stated as the WPTF
position that we oppose price caps, but if the ISO Governing Board
insisted on going down the $250/MWH price cap route, we would do what
ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage 3
alerts.  Whereas I didn=0F't think about the conversation on super-peak
block markets as being relevant to  the remarks before the Governing
Board, it became painfully clear soon after that we could, and should
work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the
California PX, or both, to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out
of Market system.

This week, WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides
discussed the merits of a super-peak block firm-energy product, and how
it could be instituted.  The meeting at the ISO, at which WPTF had many
of its members who either have generation in the State, or import power
into California, was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how
to bring more order and price transparency to the ISO's out of market
calls. The ISO reported that this summer, to date, the amount of money
spent on Out of Market purchases was about $100 million.  Last year the
total cost of Out of Market purchases was $1.7 million.

APX and CalPX, in response to our earlier discussions with them,
presented their proposals at the meeting.  The discussions which ensued
during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might
utilize a product/service to reduce the manpower requirements currently
needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls, typically on short
notice, and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids
into either the APX or CalPX's proposed system for a super-peak
firm-energy product.

There were no  commitments made by any party, simply a willingness to
work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding
sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater
transparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.

We=0F'll keep you posted on our development of this market.

>>> The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A Response

Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers, much as I
did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story
called the Trial of Gow Jing.  Mike sent me a note that I would like to
share. He said I could.  I want you to read it and appreciate that there
are other people who share his view.  I also copied the response I sent
to Michael, a.k.a. Old Deuteronomy.

Michael wrote:

=0F"I'm not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama [the
Gow-Jing story], but I did want to offer an observation.  In simpler
times, people knew the other people that they did business with, and
they typically lived in the same community.  If a merchant tried to
charge exorbitant prices for his products, even if he was the only one
in town who had the product in stock, he would face the wrath of his
fellow citizens.  This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such
behavior, even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC. Telling Mrs. Jones that
the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her $50 would not
be a pleasant way to do business, and such things ordinarily did not
happen.

=0F"In the modern global economy, of course, this personal aspect of doing
business has been almost completely lost.  And so has the restraint.  I
have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people (jeez,
I know many of them), but they work in an environment where the end
results of their business decisions are invisible.  If Mrs. Jones can't
afford to run her refrigerator any more, that fact is at best dimly
perceived, and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social
program, not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior.

=0F"This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism, because both
scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system.  But
certainly something fundamental has changed, and not for the better in
my view.  Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of
every transaction-- their jobs may even depend upon it-- and no one is
responsible for the end result.  Is this the kind of world we want to
live in???

=0F"PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY!  YOU CAN EVEN
BLAME ME, SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE
AGE.      Deut=0F"

Okay.  It=0F's in the Burrito.  And here is what I think.

You allude to the change in a world that was once =0F"more personal=0F" and=
 is
now institutional.  You make the point that things are not better off if
for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability.  But I
don=0F't think that in all cases the more personal world is lost.  It is
ever present, as I will argue below.  Second, your group embraces the
impersonal =0F"efficiencies=0F" when it is convenient.  Finally and most
importantly, where will your social-minded and like minded counterparts
be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand, which might
happen in a handful of years?

However, your essential point is not lost on me.  I do believe that
there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in
California.  I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your
response.

First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy.  I
exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my
consulting engagements which require financial give and take between
client and vendor.  It is simply smart business to do so.  I have been
the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in
my checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedly
late, etc., and the late fee forgiven.  However, much of our economy,
and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the
use of markets.  Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all the
efficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharing
of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the
initial producer.  The producer and consumer get out of the risk
arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.

I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it has
done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in
the ISO=0F's congestion management reform.  Elimination of market
separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to
execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the
name of market efficiency.  Lower prices for consumers.  Does it really
matter if it is done through person to person transactions, or through
markets?

Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point.  What
happens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next town
down the road?  All the faithful customers that your Merchant of
Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater
inventory, more choice, and lower prices.  What do you say, then?  The
corollary for us is direct.  The new generation owners moved literally
billions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance.  It
paid off.  They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably will
next year, and so on.  But the 3,000 MW of new power plants under
construction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction in
Arizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects in
California, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits
will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized.  The
prices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want to
know, where will today=0F's accusers be when there is a shake out?
Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But the
alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.
You gotta make hay while the sun shines.

Now to my proposal.   Michael, I would be willing to work with you to
develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial
customers that would, in effect, reduce the economic hardship of higher
electricity prices.  I could imagine, although I haven=0F't tested the idea
with any parties,  that a significant program could be crafted, possibly
secured by the credit of participating generating companies, and
executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America.
Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees.
It=0F's simply smart business, not charity.  It=0F's one way to amortize th=
e
earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative
to the sudden growth of demand for power.

Maybe that is a step in the right direction, I don=0F't know. One could
argue that it is no different than SDG&E implementing a level payment
plan for it=0F's consumers.  True, it is no different, because in either
case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative
fees, and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more
efficient (am I getting impersonal?) than one instituted by a
monopoly.   Second, the security for these loans is provided by parties
other than the utility=0F's customers.  Further, we wouldn=0F't have to wor=
ry
about PUC oversight and prudence reviews.  We could make this work
quickly.

I will be very interested to hear your thoughts, and the comments of my
members.  Thanks for sending us your letter.

 @@@ Finish the Story Contest

Well, there was only one response, and that was from Carl Imparato.
Here is what Carl said,

=0F"Am I missing something? Who is Gow-Jing supposed to represent? (Yes, I
get the pun in the name.  But is he also just an anonymous "everyman" or
is there someone in particular?)

=0F"My first response to your question is that Gow-Jing simply replies
=0F`Itai!=0F' (You could look it up... I think it's Chinese for =0F`it hurt=
s!=0F').
Then he takes out a concealed axe, goes on a rampage and kills
everyone.  But that's too realistic, so don't use that ending.  Instead:


=0F"Ending:  Just as he was about to reply, a giant 500 foot wall of water
swept through the room, drowning everyone.  And they lived happily ever
after.  The end."

I haven=0F't decided whether to name this response Carl=0F's Gilgamesh Epic
(I.e., Noah and the flood), or Carl=0F's Hydro Dream.  We=0F'll leave the
contest open for another week.  Can=0F't let $5 bucks go the only entry.

 @@@ What Makes Houston, Houston?

Dan Douglass of Arter and Hadden sent us the following item. Houston,
the unofficial home of the electric power industry, is a town you either
love or hate.  Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber
of Commerce of the 4th largest city to enable their many visitors to
cope.

=0F=07   First you must learn to pronounce the city  name. It is YEWS-TUN a=
nd
it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places.

=0F=07   Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Houston has its ow=
n
version of traffic rules. Never forget that downtown Houston is composed
entirely of one way streets. The only way to get out of center of town
is to
turn around and start over when you reach Dallas, Texas.

=0F=07   All directions start with, "Go down  Westheimer..."

=0F=07   Westheimer has no beginning and no end.

=0F=07   It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street  yo=
u
started on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a "scenic  drive".

=0F=07   The 8am rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30am. The 5:00 pm rush hour is
from 3:30 to 6:30 pm.  Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.

=0F=07   If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot be from Houston=
.

=0F=07   Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native, so do not
attempt the phonetic pronunciation. People will simply tilt their heads
to the right and stare at you.

=0F=07   Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life, and a permanent
form of entertainment.

=0F=07   Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase=
,
" Oh, we're in Montrose!!"

=0F=07   Construction crews aren't doing their job properly  unless they
close down all lanes except one during rush hour.

=0F=07   If  someone actually has their turn signal on, it was probably lef=
t
on at the factory where the car was made.

=0F=07   White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a=
ny
known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop
signs.

=0F=07   All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln
Continentals have the right of way.

=0F=07   The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a  legal right to
turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right  lane. YOU HAVE
BEEN WARNED!

=0F=07   Buying a  Houston street map is a waste of money since there is
absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to
avoid major road construction.

=0F=07   Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered
species list. The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled
environment for their own safety.

=0F=07   Sir" and "Ma'am" are used by the person speaking to you if there's=
 a
remote  possibility that you're at least 30 minutes older than they are.

=0F=07   "Sugar" is a more common form of  address than "Miss". So is
"Honey". Do not take offense. This is how southerners address grown
women.

=0F=07   In Houston we drink Coca-Cola  and Dr. Pepper. It is rumored that
other soft drinks are sold here, but no one will admit to knowing anyone
who actually drinks them.  So don't ask for any other soft drink.

=0F=07   What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental
Airport: Your arrival gate is at least 32 miles away from the Main
Concourse of any terminal.  Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes
are advised.

=0F=07   Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic. The bumper
sticker that reads, "Keep honking, I'm reloading" is considered fair
warning.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Have a great weekend, y=0F'all.

Bob & Leslie,

Sally asked me to set up several meetings for next week.   1st one - subject:  exactly what CommodityLogic is going to mean to us and how it will work for us.  She wants the two of you plus:  Leslie - can you designate your best person for ConfirmLogic & InvoiceLogic and Bob your best person for NomLogic.  Probably 1 &1/2 hours Monday.  Please let me know your availability.

2nd one:  Will probably be Thursday morning - can you check availability for this one also (2 hours).  Participants would be all of the above + Greg Piper, Tom Gros, Carrie Slagle, Project Managers for InvoiceLogic, ConfirmLogic, & BankLogic + Mark Taylor in Legal.  Purpose:  Discussion between Project Managers and end users on CommodityLogic.

I will wait to hear from you Monday morning re: 1st meeting.  I will talk to Greg's assistant re: his availability on Thursday and get back with you on 2nd meeting.

Thanks,
Patti x39106

Subject:	RE: Data needed for Fallon and Delaney

Is everyone responding to you on this?  If not, who are you missing?  I talked to Hall, Perlman and Rub this morning and I assume Sweeney is easy since all his operations people are EIM and EGM.  Also, Apollo and Dayao are probably EES but confirm with them.  Get hem all to respond back to you directly.  

This is also going to be very fluid.  For example, Hall has 43 names or so and we all know that probably and additional 60 or so will get put back to the estate off the UBS list if they go with their plan to take less not more.  Although all of Hall's folks are ENA, the actual names may change.  Also, Jenny Rub has about 100 employees remaining in infrastructure.  This would be desktop support, phones, the network, data centers, etc. and although some techs are dedicated to certain business units, the majority of her group will just support EWS/estate as a whole as they always have.  Her infrastructure group will therefore be shown to you as an org chart with what certain functions groups of people support.  Perlman is attempting to break out but she normally divides by commodity or application, like Unify which cuts across commodities.

Do the best you can.

Thanks.

GP

Dave Delaney and Jim Fallon need the following information for a meeting tomorrow at noon.   They need to know which BU all ENW and ISC employees support (i.e. EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, and ENA). 
I've provided all the employees that remain in the estate in the spreadsheet below for you.   There's a tab for each of you with all of your Estate employees listed.    Please designate which company each employee supports and return by 11 AM tomorrow.   
I apologize for the short notice. 
Thanks for your help.

 On the 12/11 MPR to be issued on 12/12, we will be taking a $56 million loss 
on Catalytica Energy Systems.  This asset will begin trading on the open 
market either Friday, 12/15 or Monday, 12/18 under the ticker CESIV.  The 
potential trading range of $10 - $20 per share is disclosed in the company's 
S-1.  This asset is in Raptor I and therefore this write-down will exhaust 
$56 M of the remaining Raptor I capacity.

 Please call me at x3-6983 with questions.

Hey guys and girls with the Holiday's fast approaching I am looking for a good few men and women to work the holidays.  These volunteers can work the Thanksgiving weekend, Christmas and New Years day.  You can work all of these days or just some of them.  Keep in mind that holiday pay is involved.  Let me know your preferences when you e-mail me your response.  If I get more volunteers than we need, then we will draw straws on who gets to work what holidays.  Also please e-mail your vacation request if you have any for the November and December Schedule.  The sooner I get everyones response the faster I can get the schedules out for November and December.  I almost forgot, in your e-mail let me know much you would like to work the holidays: very much, don't care one way or another, or don't want to work them at all.    That is all!!!

The dual payroll arrangement would imply dual benefits, which is not the intent.  We haven't included them in the US ERISA plans.  Since the UK benefits are a better deal, we need to document that they have waived the right to the US benefits.  Depending on how the conversation goes, you could use the discrimination rules as well.

I'll get duplicate copies to you for signature. The reason for doing this is more the former than the latter mentioned below.  However, there is a concern that other UK nationals remaining on the UK payroll could try to use the US non-discrimination rules to obtain US benefits, if you were provided both. Their success in such a challenge is questionable.

OK. Much better. Explain to me again why we have to do this? Is it purely to confirm we don't get stuff twice or is there a concern that our participation in both causes a sub-space paradox which may create a time vacuum into which the entire world population may be sucked?

David,

Let me know if this latest version is acceptable and I'll prepare a waiver for Louise and Mark, as well.

We are planning an ENA offsite on May 3rd and 4th at Columbia Lakes Resort 
(West Columbia Texas).  You were all contacted to save these dates on your 
calendars.  Both Cliff and I think this is an important opportunity for the 
business units to get together to discuss strategies and opportunities. We 
encourage you to attend for both days.

The goals of the offsite include:
 a) to discuss strategies and commercial opportunities necessary to meet our 
financial targets for 2000;
 b) to discuss resource requirements and organizational issues;
 and c) to provide an open forum to facilitate discussion and team building 
amongst the businesses.

Each business unit will have one hour to present its strategies and 
opportunities.  Specifically, we are asking the origination groups to 
describe their current strategy, detail the top 5 commercial 
deals/opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational 
issues facing the unit.  Each trading organization will be asked to give a 
short market overview of their markets, identify three market or trading 
opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that 
group.  Please submit your presentations to Kay Chapman no later than April 
28, 2000.  The agenda is quite agressive but we wanted to give everyone an 
opportunity to discuss their business.

A more detailed agenda and locations/times will follow shortly.

Regards
Delainey

Michelle, since the Plan is not administered centrally, it can be a challenge to learn what past practices were, especially if they differed from different work groups.  I've have always recommended centralized administration because an ERISA plan is required to be administered uniformly and consistently in similar circumstances.   
One place to check about past practices is Cynthia Barrow's group.  You may not know what all past practices were until the conclusion of discovery related to litigation.   
I don't know what past practices were, but I would start with Cynthia's group which I view as the source and reference point as to what the recommended practices should be.

Dorie,

I think this looks good.  I have two tweaks:

On the "Let me be clear" sentence, I'd delete the "let me be clear" 
introduction.  I think the last sentence speaks for itself.  
In the last sentence, why not conclude by saying that if they don't pay, "we 
will have no choice but to take further action on this matter" and delete the 
reference to attorneys.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Otherwise, it is good to go.

Good luck!

Michelle

Lynn, any update yet from Gary or Caroline as to the updates you requested in your December 11 email?  I am finalizing a letter to Alliant and would like to provide them with an expectation as to the October PPA's.  Specifically, will all the October charts be corrected?

Further, Alliant wants Gas Logistics to tag the PPA's.  Specifically, Alliant requested the differences are identified by gate and amount of change.  Is this possible?

Met this guy at the MAPP/MAIN/SPP conference in Chicago.  Larry V. says they are on the credit watch list, but I thought you might want to check it out anyway.

Doug...thanks for the hospitality last Tuesday night at Pheasant Run...I
enjoyed hanging out with you and Mike.

On our conversation about trading around MAPP...our assets in the Chicago
area are in an excellent position to be accessible to MidAmerican and
Alliant, and if you'd like to have your spot traders start calling us on
our real-time desk at 800.848.3975 we'd welcome the calls.  Although I
think you may find some reluctance on your side to get done with us,
clearly we can supply odd lots and load-following schedules into MAPP...and
hopefully that gets us some leverage.  If you're willing to undertake
payables to us we're more than happy to accept them.

Thanks again.

The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the "other" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says "empty deleted items folder upon exit".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
Outbound - For outbound quarantined messages, an e-mail needs to be sent to IT Security and Controls (itsecurityandcontrols@enron.com) with the recipient's address and the subject line of message.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call us at:


ETS Solution Center - Houston		713-345-4745

This report provides detail as to whether or not the book is flat net megawatts for the day.  We were able to view and print the SAR report for the remaining hourly books (ERCOT, southeast, midwest).  

Why is this problem persisting?  Please investigate this to rectify this situation.  Thanks.

Enron Europe Ltd. has played a vital role over the last few years in the=20

to=20
be used world-wide.  This strategic initiative is critical to Enron=01,s=20
performance, in insuring that trading operations services are delivered=20
consistently across all commodities and all locations. =20

We are very pleased to announce that effective April 10, 2000, Brent Price,=
=20
Vice President of Global Risk  Management Operations, will office at Enron=
=20
House, reporting to both of us.  Brent will have the responsibility and=20
authority to facilitate this global initiative for Enron Europe.  Brent=20
brings a wealth of operational and risk experience.  His most recent=20
assignment included heading Gas Operations for Enron North America. =20

Brent will have the responsibility to assist and guide us through the proce=
ss=20
of assessment and development of global operational standards and=20
measurements.  This will include evaluating the operational processes,=20
procedures and controls for all commodities and locations managed by EEL.  =

will also advise us on any critical issues requiring immediate action to=20
insure that we are fully aligned in  the delivery of global consistency=20
throughout all of our operations.  He will work actively with the operation=
s=20
staff in Enron Europe to achieve this goal. =20

(FERNLEY =01) This would be a good spot to perhaps make a reference to the=
=20
timing of Mike Jordan=01,s arrival and the role that Brent would play in hi=
s=20

We ask your full co-operation in supporting Brent and the success of this=

We remain committed to our mutual efforts to develop our people, build=20

Subject:	RE: Fastow Rumor

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

	Thanks, Jim

I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note 
regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, 
I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our 
commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 
people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor 
meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and 
yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with 
our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and 
Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net 
Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key 
Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in 
this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more 
than anything else.  --Sally

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services  

My suggestion would be to add to more floor meetings to your schedule - one 
on the operations end of the 32nd floor and one on the 37th floor.  
     
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

MEMO


Date:          December 8, 2000

From:          William J. Museler, President & Chief Executive Officer

To:       Steven J. Balser, Manager of Market Monitoring and Performance
James H. Savitt, Market Monitor

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:
HAM Transactions Failing Checkout (ECA 20001208A; re-issuance of ECA
20000907A)


Thank  you  for  the  presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance
Unit  and  the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with 
the
Market  Participants  in addressing the market design flaw concerning import 
and
export   transactions,  including  wheel-through  transactions,  that  fail  
the
check-out procedure between the completion of BME and the SCD operating 
hour.  I
am  pleased  that  the  Business  Issues Committee gave unanimous support to 
the
NYISO  to  re-issue ECA 20000907A until the Market Participants can consider 
and
approve,  and  the  NYISO can implement, a tariff change required to 
permanently
address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated in my Memorandum to you of September 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate action, remain at levels different from what would 
otherwise
occur during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20000907A while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and
post  it  on  the  OASIS,  for implementation effective at the expiration of 
ECA
20000907A.  The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days.

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208A:

Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout


Applicability

This Extraordinary Correction Action (ECA) shall apply to:

?    Import and export transactions;
?    that are scheduled for an operating hour in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM) 
by
the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME); and
?    that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market
Participant, or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant.

Wheel-through transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export
transaction, and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of 
both
financial impacts, as provided below.  This ECA shall not apply to import,
export, or wheel-through transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or
action, or neighboring control area operator error or action.

Rationale

Import Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME reduces commitments for
energy  resources  within  NYCA  to  accept  scheduled  import transactions 
at a
specific  proxy  bus  indicated  by the Market Participant.  Where the 
scheduled
import  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price 
at
the  proxy  bus  may  be  elevated  above the HAM price due to the failed 
import
transaction.   The  difference  between the real-time price and the BME price 
at
that  proxy  bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the real-time 
market.
Under  this  ECA,  this  amount  (when  positive),  multiplied  by the number 
of
megawatts  of  the  transaction  for  that  hour,  shall be billed to the 
Market
Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial 
impact
of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Export  Transactions:  During the HAM resolution, BME makes commitments for
energy  resources  to  supply  scheduled  export transactions up to the 
purchase
price  indicated  by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus.  
Where
the  scheduled  export  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to 
the
failed  export  transaction.   The  difference  between  the  BME  price and 
the
real-time  price  at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part 
of
Schedule  1  costs.   Under this ECA, this amount (when positive), multiplied 
by
the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour, shall be billed to 
the
Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the 
financial
impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Wheel-Through   Transactions:  During  the  HAM  resolution,  BME  includes
scheduled wheel-through transactions up to the transmission congestion cost 
that
equals  the  decremental  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant.  Where 
the
scheduled  wheel-through transaction fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  both  the  import  and export proxy busses may be elevated 
or
depressed,  respectively,  due  to the effects on transmission congestion of 
the
failed wheel-through transaction.  Under this ECA, the effects of the import 
and
export  portions  of  the  failed  wheel-through  transaction will be 
calculated
separately,  as though they were separate failed transactions.  The sum of 
those
impacts  shall  be  billed  to  the Market Participant that scheduled the 
failed
wheel-through  transaction  as  the  financial  impact of causing the failure 
to
complete checkout of the transaction.

Implementation Rules


1.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
delivered to the NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity
selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the
scheduling entity?s BME Bid Price, and buying the energy that was not 
delivered
from the LBMP Market at the Real-Time LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy
Generator Bus.  No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is
shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control 
Area
and the energy was not delivered due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
delivering Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the 
Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is lower
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to deliver scheduled energy.

2.   An External Transaction for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
received from NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity 
buying
the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling
entity?s BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP
Market at the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus.  No payment
will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External
Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not
taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
receiving Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is 
higher
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to take scheduled energy.

3.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at one
external Proxy Generator Bus and the delivery of energy from the NYCA at a
different external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which 
no
energy is delivered to or received from the NYCA in real-time, will be settled
by applying rules 1 and 2 of this ECA separately to the failed delivery of
energy to the import Proxy Generator Bus and the failed receipt of energy at 
the
export Proxy Generator Bus, and summing the total of the two amounts for 
payment
by the scheduling entity.  No payment will be required by the scheduling 
entity
if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each
Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an
error or action by the NYISO or the delivering or receiving Control Area.  No
payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant for the import 
or
the export portion of the External Transaction if no payment would have been
required had that portion of the transaction been a separate transaction under
rule 1 or 2 of this ECA.

The below email is in regards to the cost charts Sheri asked that I provide 
to Greg Piper.  The comment, "The goal for us is to put the information into 
a form that I can share with potential external counterparties on Tuesday" is 
why I am forwarding the email to you.  I will dig deeper to understand the 
purpose.  Also, Sally the gas chart is for both Financial and Physical and 
the increase in cost for February is due to social security and unemployment 
taxes.  These cost were incorrectly recorded to our cost centers and will be 
reversed during March.

Hi Sheri --

I hope your Mom's surgery went fine.

Thanks for pulling the info together.  I have meetings on Monday until 3pm, 
but I believe that David can get together with you on Monday morning.  
Perhaps David can pull in someone else from our team also.  The goal for us 
is to put the information into a form that I can share with potential 
external counterparties on Tuesday.  Thanks again for your help.

Dave/Rex - we have put together some information for you all.  Unfortunately, 
I need to leave for the day (my mom is in surgery this afternoon).  Can we 
get together first thing Monday?  Please leave me a voice mail as I will be 
checking in today and will have my assistant set something up.

Thanks

I've had lots of folks ask for more details on the story I reported Monday
night as Denver QB Brian Griese made my "Downgrade" list in the "Upgrades /
Downgrade" article.

According to John Clayton of ESPN, Griese's shoulder injury is a separation
of the AC joint in his right clavicle.  He took a pain killing shot and
finished the game.   Unfortunately, his status for this week's game against
San Diego is in doubt.  At this point, coach Mike Shanahan is saying it will
be a couple of days before they decide what they're doing.

I've copied the entire story below if you'd like more details.  Sounds like
this victory could be one of those career turning point games for him.
Griese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket
because he could hear the crowd hold it's breath is classic.  I'll keep an
eye on it for you as this shakes out.

Joe



>From the article:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1114/876898.html
DENVER -- Brian Griese had a secret. Mike Shanahan knew because he was the
head coach. Griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of
his right shoulder.
His teammates didn't know what went on behind closed doors in Monday's
dramatic 27-24 Broncos victory over the Raiders at Mile High Stadium. All
his teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an
ill-advised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter.
Griese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasn't missed. The
Raiders had an 11-play, field-goal drive that lasted six minutes. Teammates
saw Griese trot back to the field, warm up and miss only five plays. They
didn't hear that Griese had separated his right clavicle and AC joint and
needed a pain-deadening shot to finish the final three quarters.
"This is not a game I wanted to miss, and I was going to do anything
possible to get in the game and help my team win," Griese said. "I was going
to do it. It was just the will to play and the will to win, and I wasn't
going to come out."
An hour after the game, Broncos players were surprised that the man who ran
their huddle had a busted wing. His performance was John Elway-like for
courage, but it also leaves the Broncos uncertain if they will have Griese
available as a starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the San Diego
Chargers.
"We won't know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury, but he's
such a competitor," Shanahan said. "He's been like that since he's been
here. He wants to play, and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure
he doesn't further hurt himself. That's the kind of guy he is."
Rod Smith is among the many Broncos who have grown to love this guy. Last
year was different. In the preseason, it was supposed to be Bubby Brister's
team, but Shanahan named Griese the starter. Veterans didn't feel totally
comfortable with him. Griese didn't feel comfortable bossing around a group
of players who didn't take to him.
"Brian's the one to lead us," Smith said. "I think it would have hurt him
more just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing
with the shoulder the way it was. Whatever he does, he doesn't surprise me.
He's the best quarterback in the NFL. I know the Raiders think Rich Gannon
is. We think Brian is."
Griese told his offensive players that he didn't have too much zip on the
ball. They accepted it as just humility.
"I wasn't throwing the ball as well I have been," Griese said. "Some of the
balls just died. At that point, it was just your will to play, your will to
win. I wasn't coming out of the game."
Griese was 22-of-32 for 221 yards with a separated shoulder. He'd throw
passes and hear, as well as feel, his shoulder popping in and out.
"I knew there was something wrong with it, but they assured me that I
couldn't do any further damage," Griese said. "It was just whether I could
handle the pain."
Being injured didn't make Griese shy away from contact. Several times he
took shots from Raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen Mile High
Stadium grass. Once, cornerback Eric Allen charged untouched from the
blindside. Griese ducked as Allen hit him shoulder high.
"Believe it or not, the reason I kind of ducked when he came in is that I
heard the crowd, and the crowd held their breath and I could hear that,"
Griese said. "I said to myself, 'Well, somebody must be ready to hit me.' "
Talk about homefield advantage. Griese has never had an injury like this. He
has played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that
requires surgery, but this was much more painful.
Griese remembered a pass to Rod Smith along the sideline that was a big
play. He had to make just an arm-through pass. It was agonizing. He threw a
skinny post to Ed McCaffrey that left McCaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the
chin.
"I apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and I
didn't have any zip on the ball," Griese said.
Griese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different.
"We knew it was something that was hurting him, we knew he was banged up,"
fullback Howard Griffith said. "That's how it is when you've got a job to
do."
Still, the story told after the game amazed them.

I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron 
intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading 
in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with 
EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading 
and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast 
(PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been 
interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position 
caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please 
let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

Ignacio

We've been keeping this deal in because I've been concerned about congestions at COB.  I'm not concerned going into February, so this contract is out of the money for February (probably in March thru May however).  If there is some reason to keep it whole, we have the length at COB.  Let me know what we want to do.

Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting=
 activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.

Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits an=
d has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, t=
he permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this=
 e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is comple=
te, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prio=
r to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on Octob=
er 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  =
The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov=
. 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is locat=
ed approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is =
the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have b=
een no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review proc=
ess, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for meas=
uring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fu=
el monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced t=
hem otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur anal=
yzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There wa=
s also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter =
emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer f=
or the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has =
also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  T=
here are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public c=
omment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this dat=
e, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign=
 off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As=
 of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the per=
mits for station 3 and or 4.

Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

Subject: Commodity Logic

Leslie Reeves is working on the Tom Gros project (let me know if you need 
details on this).  She has asked for top 25 counterparties on EnronOnline.   
In short, there is a new Texas law in the works that will allow for 
electronic confirming of deals, and they want to determine if any of the top 
25 are Texas companies so that we can pursue confirming deals 
electronically.  

Just wanted to get your approval before sending it on to her.

thanks

Attached is the top 25 deal count C/P for EnronOnline for US Gas & US Power.
This is what I will forward to Leslie Reeves once I get the OK from Louise or 
Sally through you.

Leslie Reeves will be working with Mary Solmonson to identify which of these 
counter-parties reside in the state of Texas.

Just let me know when I can forward this to Leslie.
Thanks.

MAGAZINE INDUSTRY WANTS TO GAIN AD WEIGHT IN 2002
By Linnea Anderson, Writer
Still reeling from the one-two combination of the dot-com collapse
and September 11, the magazine industry is looking to get its legs
back in 2002. The dearth of advertising pages in 2001 was a sharp
contrast to 2000, when, flush with advertising dollars from the
tech sector, many publications were as thick as phone books and
rolling in revenue. Read more.http://Hoovers.ym0.net/re3.asp?c=34673&p=109912&e=27946744 ===========

John, the prior conversations concerning these assets indicated that the non-JEDI 2 ownership of some of these assets resided in the WhiteWing structure. WhiteWing also involves outside equity, and in addition to other concerns, has limitations on sales below contributed value [the book value on the transfer to WhiteWing]. Given the current situation concerning related party transactions, I recommend approval from the Enron Corp. Board prior to any related party transaction, as well as the approval of JEDI 2 and in the case of WhiteWing, at least a majority of the outside equity.

Teresa, if these activities are under active consideration, I suggest we schedule meetings with Mark Haedicke and Jeff McMahon.

John,  It has come to my attention that we are looking at selling several of the E&P investments to a related party.  Because of the current issues Enron is having with related party transactions, such a sale will require Enron as GP of JEDI II, to obtain the LPs consent - obviously this mean CalPERS as I am assuming we would consent to our own deal.  I have spoken with CalPERS briefly regarding the proposed sale and they do not seem immediately inclined to permit such a sale.  Please give me a call so we can discuss.  Thanks.  Shirley x34859

As discussed:

What happens to my wages/salary if the Company files for bankruptcy
protection?

The general rule is that a company that has filed a banruptcy petition is
not able to make payments on any prepetition debts until a plan of
reorganization is filed.

However, there are certain exceptions to the general rule.

Claims related to wages and salary earned within 180 days of a bankruptcy
petition filing (called "prepetition wages and salaries") receive a special
priority for upt to $4650 under the bankruptcy code (section 507(a)(3)) and
are usually paid in full as part of the plan of reorganization.  Most
companies that intend to continue operating while in bankruptcy recognize
the need to keep employees working and the potential hardship that would
occur of wages were not paid or delayed.  As a result, most companies that
file a bankruptcy petition, but which inetend to remain in business, seek
the specific authority of the bankruptcy court to make payments on the
priority wage claims immediately so that employees will experience little
or no disruption in their wage/salary payments while they continue working.
Usually this authority is sought at the same time or shortly after a
bankruptcy petition is filed.  For a company that derives a great deal of
its value from its employees, making sure these payments are made in a
timely manner is a high priority.

uninterested in shorting the dollar.

the euro has also suffered from a japanese overhang.  when the euro was first
released, japanese bot up the euro with the expectation that other countries
would convert some of their reserves into the euro.  this has not been the case
and japan has been puking out their position.  however, there is a belief that
the selling is over.  (though, i'm not sure when this played out, or how to
check this story.  haven't found measure for money flow.  oh, bloomberg, how i
miss thee.)

so, i guess i still like it.  but who knows, i'm probably the mullet retail
investor that gets run over.  the currency market is very efficient.

The attached spreadsheet shows the availability of staff over the holidays. 

I'll be on vacation through the remainder of the year, returning to the office Jan 2nd. I will be in town. Do not
hesitate to contact me. I will be checking my email from time to time, and phone mail messages will page 
me. 

Have a safe and happy holiday.

I know the message is 'business as usual' but with some changes inevitable down the line, I'm just checking for all the people 'in the pipeline' for moves from overseas.....is it still a 'go' ?  

Please keep me in the loop if you think there may be changes to current plans for Neil's move.

Thanks

Per Dave's note below - sounds like he want to insure the managers are 
staying on top of this and wants proof.  Please keep working with the 
managers and push this through.  Any that you have now, please forward to me 
so I can update the status report and forward to Dave.

Rick,
Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss how the Raptor unwind is accomplished from a mechanical standpoint, as well as, what comes back to Enron in the transaction.  I would happy to sit down and walk you through it.  Just let me know when might work for you to get together.  Thanks Rick,
Ron Baker

I think that all investments that were hedged in Raptor are on th MPR and are being monitored and reported against.  Is this true?  Ron, will you take the lead in making sure we have a smooth transition on this?  Thanks

Now that Raptor is blown up, should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio. I am not familiar with details of how it unwound so I don't know what we are left with. Is this worth a meeting with you or your designesss? Rick

Subject: 


By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise and reports of the destruction from the terrorist attacks on the US. These were deplorable acts that we will never forget. But now is a time to look at the other side of the numbers coming out of New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. 

The sad but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream media has not reported yet- the SURVIVAL rates and some positive news about the attacks. 

*** The Buildings *** 

* The World Trade Center - 

The twin towers of the World Trade Center were places of employment for some 50,000 people. With the missing list of just over 5,000 people, that means 90% of the people targeted survived the attack. A 90% on a test is an 'A'. 

* The Pentagon - 

Some 23,000 people were the target of a third plane aimed at the Pentagon. The latest count shows that only 123 lost their lives. That is an amazing 99.5% survival rate. in addition, the plane seems to have come in too low, too early to affect a large portion of the building.On top of that, the section that was hit was the first of five sections to undergo renovations that would help protect the Pentagon from terrorist attacks. It had recently completed straightening and blast-proofing, savinguntold lives. This attack was sad, but a statistical failure. 

*** The Planes *** 

* American Airlines Flight 77 
This Boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of the Pentagon could have carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard. Luckily 78% of the seats were empty. 

* American Airlines Flight 11 
This Boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people aboard, but only carried 92. Thankfully 74% of the seats were unfilled. 

* United Airlines Flight 175 
Another Boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people only had 65 people on board. Fortunately it was 81% empty. 


* United Airlines Flight 93 

This Boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting stories yet. The smallest flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out of a possible 289 had 84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood up to the attackers and thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a national landmark, saving untold numbers of lives in the process. 

*** In Summary *** 
Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly targeted by these inept cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's a higher survival rate than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney transplants and liver transplants - all common, survivable illnesses 

The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon was hit at it's strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people in the World Trade Center buildings escaped, and a handful of passengers gave the ultimate sacrifice to save even more lives. 

Pass this information on to those in fear and the media. Don't fear these terrorists. The odds are against them.

Mr. Nowlan:

When we spoke several days ago, I had mentioned the meeting between Jeff 
Shankman and Larry Kellner, CFO, at Continental Airlines.  The meeting had 
been scheduled for December 11th, 2-3 PM in EB 3321.  I will know tomorrow if 
this date is confirmed.  Following our phone conversation, I did follow up 
with the persons you suggested -- Larry Gagliardi, Douglas Friedman and Mark 
Tawney -- as I completed an overview of our initiatives with Continental.

The meeting on December 11th will enable Enron and Continental to continue 
discussions on three initiatives listed in order of economic value:  (1) fuel 
management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR 
analysis.  

In order to verify attendees at this meeting, Jennifer Burns suggested that I 
follow up with you.  Please note the Continental attendees listed below.  Did 
you want to have the same origination team at the meeting or others?  I look 
forward to your response so I can coordinate with them and confirm their 
attendance.  Continental had requested that we keep the Enron attendance to 3 
or 4 persons; they will do the same.

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)


We appreciate your suggestions.
Thank-you.

Shona -
RAC and Risk Ops are in this together and of course we'll continue to help in 
understanding the violations.  I recognize and sympathize with the strain 
your group is under with all the systems problems, the UK DPR  issues, the 
increased limit change and policy compliance activity, etc..  My suggestions 
were: 1) meant to streamline the process for you by making your data 
gathering process easier, 2) I was offering to "be the bad guy" and point out 
to the traders what we want them to do, and 3)meant to strengthen the 
effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of 
increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their 
accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits.

I think the confusion here is  violation explanations being "validated" by 
the traders as you indicated below, vs. "provided" by the traders as we 
envision.  I confirmed with Ted, the traders are accountable for providing 
the explanation.  I'm not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back 
to your efforts of getting memos out earlier.  We're suggesting the traders 
should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning, so that you 
do not have to go through all the effort as you do now, of trying to track 
people down in the afternoon and get explanations.  It should be the traders 
responsibility to get them to you, and they should be reviewing their 
positions every morning before they even begin trading., and should be able 
to easily explain why they're in violation or why they had a big loss.  
Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail, or they 
talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you 
- whatever you think makes sense and works for you.   I'm not trying to 
manage the process, just to help design one that makes it easier for you and 
is still effective from a risk management stand point.

At this point in this long series of e-mails, why don't we just talk face to 
face.  I can tell from your response you feel we're somehow not being team 
players, but that is not my intent at all.  I've tried to go out of my way 
the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and 
appreciates your efforts.  And really, I thought I was helping by using the 
policy's influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the 
time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting.  

Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate.  We can talk 
about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RAC's 
expectations.  I agree, we do have significant mid-office needs, and you have 
been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC;  
and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk 
reporting is required every day by Skilling.  We can continue to work on 
streamlining processes, but maybe we need to think about staffing in our 
respective groups and corresponding responsibilities.  I'm willing to do 
whatever is needed, and I don't think Ted is hung up on who does what 
either.  It's just that right now we're staffed with the expectation that 
Sally's group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of 
activities related to our risk management systems.


Best Regards,
Cassandra.

Subject: Re: Limit Violations and Notifications Process  

Dear Cassandra,

Thanks for the message.  I believe it if fully understood by us and the 
individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the 
traders.  Are you in addition saying that your group (who has been very 
helpful in the past) will no longer help us understand the cause of 
violations/notifications?  To me, this appears contrary to a team spirit 
attitude, and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed 
earlier today.  Also, we are working toward getting the memos out earlier, 
and this is a real set back to that process.

Thoughts?

Subject: Limit Violations and Notifications Process

Shona -

To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template 
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group 
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your 
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised 
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until 
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L 
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday 
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should 
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business 
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.

Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation 
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that 
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is 
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the 
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops 
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these 
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit 
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance 
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit 
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback 
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like 
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just 
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their 
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long 
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and 
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based 
on the market moves, etc.. 

Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.

Regards,
Cassandra.

Dear Cassandra,

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to 
ensure it meets your requirements.

Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use "WSCC", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the "Re:" say "Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000"
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

The above transaction was presented to the Board on 1-29-2001. There was 
considerable discussion which I have summarized below.

Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk. I answered 
positively, which is what the capital price addresses. The dash return is a 
blended debt and equity return.(?)

Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate. I 
answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be 
needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.

Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon. 
I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal 
and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below 
outstanding. We will have to watch this issue carefully.

Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem? 
Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come 
into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough 
cash to operate.

This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and 
not a rubber stamp.

 Rick

We have received the water well survey for the N. Crawar site. The Crane 
County Water District owns 11 water wells within a one mile radius of the 
site. The nearest well is located about 1000 feet east of the site. It 
appears that all of the wells are completed into the uppermost aquifer and, 
in general, are screened from 50' bgs to total depth at about 140' bgs. The 
shallow water table at the site and in the nearby wells is at about 50' bgs. 
The groundwater flow direction at the site has consistently been toward due 
south. There are no water supply wells within one mile due south of the site. 
There are two monitor wells at the east side of the site which have always 
produced clean samples. The remediation system for this site should be 
operational by April 1, 2001. We will also have more current groundwater 
sampling information for the site within the next few weeks.

Ongoing:
Defining the size of the market:
? There may be three =01+levels=01, of markets for these services - one for=

offerings, and yet a larger market if we think of our offering as transacti=

? There are a number of ways to derive the potential market size.  The=20

services based on their current and projected deal volumes. =20

During my meeting with Kathryn Cordes the other day, I mentioned to her that I was having lunch with Mirant (formerly Southern Company Energy Mktg.) and wanted to know the status of any contact that Tom Gros may have had with them so that I would know how to handle my discussions with them.  Early on, we had asked that CommodityLogic  target companies like AEP and Mirant for ConfirmLogic.  Kathryn mentioned that they were also thinking of talking to El Paso.

Tom called me yesterday and asked for a contact name at El Paso.  I told him about my planned lunch with Mirant as well.  He asked me to get a contact name for Mirant as well.  

I received some information from Mirant today that actually helps our case for ConfirmLogic.  They informed me that they have just visited with AEP regarding deals transacted on the Intercontinental Power Exchange (ICE) platform (Mirant is a stakeholder in that trading platform).  AEP wants to eliminate confirmations for trades on that platform and want the Automatch function.  He said that AEP's IT dept. is ready to take that step.  He also made the comment that Mirant's IT dept. is very lacking and is not ready to perform the automatch function.  He did say that they would be receptive to verifying the deal information electronically and eliminating the confirmations. He felt that technology wise, they were 3 years behind where we are.   

Our advantage is that we want to automatch the entire universe of deals (Broker, EOL, Direct trades, trades done on other platforms (i.e. Dynegy Direct, ICE, etc.)) rather than just a subset of deals (i.e. Trades done on ICE as AEP suggested).

Just want to pass this on to you to see if you had any concerns about providing this information to Tom.  I was planning on sending him an email tomorrow to give him the contact information.  Let me know.

Shel,  Everything ok except enron has credible attack threat.  Cops all in our two buildings , Mike said had bomb dogs in gas control. Many , many cops outside our buildings and in garage.  Called Linda Laferla at home for a comp day to access our system and monitor just in case. I'm sure you have already heard all about it.  Maybe we need to talk to our bunch about it.

Subject:	TETCO ASA and Global Settlement Filing Effective 12/1/01

November 8, 2001


To: S-2 Customers

Re: TETCO ASA and Global Settlement Filing Effective 12/1/01

On October 31, 2001 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation 
(TETCO) filed its annual Applicable Shrinkage Adjustment (ASA) 
and its final Order No. 636 Transition Cost filing in Docket No. 
RP02-36-0000.  Included in the filing were revised rates and ASA 
percentages designed to retain in-kind the projected quantities 
of gas required for the operation of TETCO's system, including 
percentages under Rate Schedule X-28 which Transco utilizes to 
render service under its Rate Schedule S-2.  The revised rates 
and fuel percentages have a proposed effective date of December 
1, 2001, and if accepted as proposed would result in the 
following changes in Transco's Rate Schedule S-2 rates and fuel 
percentages: 

Injection Rate - $0.0020 decrease
Withdrawal Rate - $0.0048 decrease
Injection Fuel Percentage - 0.08% decrease
Inventory Level Fuel Percentage - 0.02% decrease
Withdrawal Fuel Percentages:
     Winter Period - 0.03% increase
     Spring, Summer and Fall Periods - 0.09% decrease

Reyna and I have reviewed and discussed your question and provide the following as guidelines for allocating storage:

Allocate storage during the Timely, Evening, Non-Grid, and IntraDay 1 cycles whenever net scheduled storage activity exceeds the operational capacity by more than 500 MMBtu.
Allocate storage during the IntraDay 2 Cycle if a storage allocation was performed during any of that gas day's earlier cycles (using the 500 MMBtu Rule) or when there were no previous storage allocations were performed during the gas day but the net scheduled storage activity for the IntraDay 2 cycle exceeds operational capacity by more than 5,000 MMBtu. 

If you have any additional questions, please advise.

Customer Service Reps. have requested from the Storage Group some allocation guidelines to follow as to when to call Storage on whether or not to allocate storage. For example if only 4,000 DTH needs allocated do we allocate or do we call to see if storage wants to lift the allocation. Can you provide us with some guidelines to follow even if it for us to allocate no mater how much is over capacity, that information would eliminate some concerns the Customer Service Reps. have.

I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the complaint 
form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the
form is the same that hired there ticketing help.

-E

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful 
except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for 
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride 
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the 
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because 
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for 
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of 
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no 
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which 
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was 
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline 
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us 
to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that 
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible 
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this 
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on 
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.  
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my 
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.  
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed 
our connection we were forced to spend a combined 
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, 
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead 
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten 
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of 
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again 
because of this experience.

For your research I provide the following data:
Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna 
Husser, and Donnita Franklin.

Final Itinerary (after all changes) -
Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AM
Flt. 6244 Dec. 09 Phx-Mtj 3:34PM

Flt. 6241 Dec. 14 Mtj-Phx 9:00AM
Flt. 2273 Dec. 14 Phx-Iah  1:15PM

Sincerely,

Eric Bass

One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective.

A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.

Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson.  Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls.  

To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process.  In this regard, your cooperation with Rick and his team is appreciated.

Team,

Attached is an EOTT Facilities List I got from Dave Odneal.  I believe it has 
every EOTT facility listed on it for every state EOTT operates in.  I am sure 
it will be useful.

Lucy,

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet 
them?  If so, what did you think?

Phillip

Don:

It was nice meeting you on the phone today.  I appreciate the time you
extended to me and
it was great to hear your interest in our power indexes/historical data as
applicable to your departmental needs.

As we discussed, I am pleased to mention, the growth and market penetration
of TNE is rapidly increasing.  In fact, over the last couple of weeks a
sampling of our contractual successes include:

A. Enron-specifically named license (3 users only) used for back office
accounting functions
    (note, this license is not for distribution and for WEB access and
indices only)
B  Top three (3) eastern power marketer serving over 43 million
homes/businesses
C. Top 10 energy company that handles approx. $250 billion in energy
transactions per year
   while producing 141.3 million physical MWh in 2000.

As mutually agreed upon, I will contact you the week of August 13th (upon my
return from business trips & vacation) to further discuss your requirements
in more detail.  We look forward to growing and expanding our relationship
with Enron and your department.  Thank you.

Mark, Thanks very much for your observations in response to my environmenta=
l =20
memo. I think I understand some of your concerns about the role of the ISO=
=20
in  general and, in particular, with regard to conservation programs. There=
=20
are  several ways in which I think the NYISO is inextricably involved with=
=20
energy  efficiency:=20

The current competitive market the NYISO is overseeing is quite simply not =
=20
working when it comes to demand or load responding to prices. Supply or =20
generators are responding to price=01*imperfectly, but there is significant=
 =20
response. So we have "half a market." We should be seeking to put demand on=
=20
a  par with supply=01*treating load equally with generation. We are moving =
in=20
the  direction of facilitating that, but with basically all consumers on fl=
at=20
or  average rates, and with almost all LSEs (the regulated distribution=20
companies)  able to pass along their energy costs, there is little basis fo=
r=20
responding to  high prices even when we have the software mechanisms in pla=
ce=20
to do so.  Someone needs to find a way to have consumers confronting real=
=20
prices=01*or at  least paying a risk premium for not having to do so. Someo=
ne=20
needs to find a  way to have LSEs have a financial incentive to keep prices=
=20
down=01*they don=01,t  now. One way LSEs could do so would be to encourage =
their=20
(fixed price)  customers, through incentives, to reduce their use when pric=
es=20
are high.  Environmentally, there is a lot at stake in getting the market t=
o=20
work right,  and the ISO plays a major role in that, even when it is not it=
s=20
immediate  responsibility.=20
The emergency measures the ISO is considering have very significant =20
environmental impacts. Small diesel generators may be needed to avoid the =
=20
significant social costs of outages. One environmental concern here is that=
 =20
such generators be restricted to emergency conditions, and not become a new=
 =20
breed of economic peak clippers. And also, it seems reasonable that the =20
emergency program "clean up after itself" by having offsets or mitigation =
=20
associated with it. Actual demand reductions are a preferable alternative =
=20
since they do not have health and environmental impacts=01*and help lower=
=20
market  prices at the same time.=20

I don=01,t mean to suggest that the NYISO is responsible for all of the iss=
ues =20
raised here=01*clearly the PSC, DEC, NYSERDA and others have very important=
=20
roles.  I think the NYISO needs to work with these other agencies to get=20
competition to  work more or less right, and pull down prices and protect t=
he=20
environment at the  same time.=20

Sorry if I have fallen into the trap of repeating myself=01(at length. Than=
ks =20

Hi Monika,

Welcome to the pulp and paper world.

In order to understand the index system, the first thing is to look at our
web-site www.foex.fi which includes a lot of information, particularly in
this case the FAQ section. You probably have taken a look at that already,
though.

Our two pulp indexes, NBSKP (Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft) and BHKP
(birch+eucalyptus) cover the European market. As abt 40% of the world pulp
trade is for the European market, these are, in a way, considered to be the
"world market prices", particularly as the third biggest market, North
America (Asia is the second biggest) has virtually the same prices as
Europe; correlation between the two is well over 0.9.

The sellers reporting to us are, by definition, in NBSKP from Canada, US
West Coast and the Nordic countries. BHKP (birch, euca) sellers are from the
Nordic region, Latin America, Spain and Portugal and a number of
Asian/African companies selling Eucalyptus pulp to the European market.
Buyers are European producers of paper and paperboard buying at least some
of their pulp from the open market, representing virtually all countires in
Western Europe. The split between birch and euca is approximately 30%/70%,
again reflecting the actual situation in the European market.

The exact coverage is difficult to calculate as some of the data received
from buyers are from same deals which are reported by the sellers and some
are not. The producers reporting to us represent roughly 80% of the supply
to Europe in the two benchmark grades.

Most (=80-90%) of the pulp sold in Europe is so-called contract business.
This means that a buyer and a seller have an annual or multiannual contract
covering the grades and volumes, quantity rebates etc. However, prices are
fixed also for contract business on a monthly/quarterly basis. Most of the
pulp arriving Continental Europe or UK from abroad, goes through consignment
warehouses (in places like Antwerp, Rotterdam, La Pallice, Tilbury,
Savono-Livorno range etc.). As forwarding companies allow 30-60 days of free
storage, buyers do not hold much inventory at their mills but take the pulp,
delivered by sellers in large shipments, little be little by lorry, rail or
barge. Each delivery is invoiced separately and those invoice prices are the
price reported to us, before customer specific rebates. Prices are for prime
grade pulp and for delivery during the current or latest for the following
month.

The following comments are worth making:
- Our system is based on first taking off top 10% and bottom 10% of the
prices received and only then calculating the index (or rather benchmark)
values. This way we avoid any clerical errors in the data received as well
as any theoretical attempts of manipulation (we have never detected any
attempts)
- We have a more or less equal number of prices received from buyers and
sellers. Some we receive through agents/merchants/trading houses - usually
mandated by a supplier to give us the price data
- If someone does not report their prices on a given week, we can use the
previous week's data but only once
- Prices are not volume-weighted (in order to avoid the manipulation
possibility and unnecessary weekly changes up and down because a supplier
sold one week to large customers and next week to small ones)
- Prices are CIF European port before customer-specific rebates (again to
avoid unnecessary volatility of the index at a time when prices remain
unchanged; also, rebates are often given only afterwards - e.g. when
exceeding a certain tonnage threshhold - and we cannot alter our indexes
retroactively)
- Our index system is approved by financial regulators and by European
Community anti-trust regulators (=DG IV) and audited by
PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
- There is a group of independent experts, case need, as "trouble shooters".
Never have had any and never have received any official complaints about the
index values.
- Participation is totally voluntary
- The main reasons for differences between the often compared FOEX indexes
and Pulpex quotations include:
a) our prices are before customer-specific rebates (averaging 5-6%), Pulpex
prices are net
b) our prices are for contract business, Pulpex prices represent the lowest
spot-levels in a weak market and highest spots in a strong market
c) our price info is based on actual sales, Pulpex prices are expectations
what the spot price might be in e.g. 3 month's time
d) our price is for a prime quality (within each benchmark grade there are
surprisingly large differences between individual mill grades sold) approved
by a seller from a particular supplier/mill, whilst Pulpex prices, based on
a delivery concept (i.e. you do not accept the price offered to close a
contract, you can make/take delivery), are prices in a particular inventory
location (3-4 alternative ones), sometimes far away from buyer's or seller's
normal ports for any lot (often unknown/unwanted grade, up to 11 months and
29 days old goods). This system tends to emphasize in the Pulpex system the
extreme prices, up or down, particularly in these early stages with low
liquidity.
- Our indexes are trade-marked products. Therefore their use for any
commercial purposes is possible only with our permission. To get that
permission, users pay us a small premium, the main source of our income.
Enron and FOEX Indexes Ltd. have a contract, Bob Crane has the details at
your end.

I trust this is helpful. I encourage you to contact us anew for any
additional questions.

Please find enclosed, for order's sake our pulp specs, some additional
comments we send to the price providers and the historical price series you
asked for (historical series are still without today's indexes, to be
published about an hour from sending this message; you can add those from
our web-site by the time you read this).

My best regards to you as well as to David and Elizabeth.

Hello Mr. Teras,

My name is Monika Causholli and I am a new analyst working at Enron
Industrial Markets concentrating in pulp. I work with David Allan and
Elizabeth Hutchinson whom you met in the conference in Las Vegas.

I am in the process of understanding the pulp market and how it works.
Right now I am working on a project where I have to analyze the FOEX
index and the methodology behind it. I have seen one of the
presentations that you have presented in the States a while ago but I am
looking for a little bit more detail. For example, what kind of
companies you contact, what percentage of industry they represent in
terms of tonnage, markets that they represent, what geographic area
these companies represent and anything else that you think its important
to know.

I would very much appreciate your help in the matter,

sincerely,
MOnika Causholli

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had been withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only included the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amounts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on track.

4:00-9:00 pm at the Regal Ranch.  Many of you may have already received thi=

outing with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you=
 please.

Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us f=
or a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executive=
s in your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this typ=
e of exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm=
 within the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuab=
le, and appreciated.

If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension=

Thank you,

Hey, I meant to check in with you and see how your dinner went at La Columbe 
d'Or.   I have to admit, I was jealous....

Matt fell through as the Christmas party date...so Noel is going (so nice to 
have friends who don't mind filling in as last minute dates!).  Maybe we'll 
see you guys there.

Had fun hanging out with you at/after the meeting on Friday.  I think that's 
the most I've ever talked to you in one sitting!!  We'll have to do it again 
soon....

Take care!
Amy

Subject: Selling to ENRON


Yesterday afternoon (1/8/01) during a conference call with ENRON, there was
a discussion regarding issues associated with hourly sales to ENRON in
order to define expectations associated with these hourly sales. Below is a
summary of the expectations and conclusions reached.

Non-Firm Energy Sales:
Duke Power regards a verbal commitment to sell non-firm hourly energy to a
customer as an agreement for Duke to sell/deliver energy to the designated
delivery point and the customer, ENRON, to purchase/receive this energy at
the designated delivery point with ENRON taking the risk of obtaining
transmission paths beyond the designated delivery point and completing
required tags correctly. After a non-firm energy schedule has begun and a
new official TLR event occurs which results in curtailing the schedule,
Duke considers this a Force Majuere event and ENRON will only be billed for
the energy delivered.

Take or Pay Energy Sales:
Duke Power regards a verbal commitment to sell Take or Pay energy to a
customer as an agreement for  the customer, ENRON, to purchase this energy
at the designated delivery point with ENRON taking all risks and accepting
to purchase all energy scheduled.

ENRON expressed the desire to develop  a strong relationship with Duke
built on conducting business "the right way". The ENRON Real-time Desk
Management is committed to this desire and are our contacts for future
problems and concerns.

There have been growing concerns regarding the copying and distribution of 
licensed and copyrighted materials among various groups within Enron.  For 
example, if you are a subscriber to Petroleum Argus, Intelligence Press, 
Energy Intelligence, Opis, or any other information source, it is unlawful to 
copy and distribute that information among others if only one 
license/subscription is ordered.

Such activity exposes Enron to legal ramifications and reflects poorly on our 
reputation as a professional and ethical company. 

If you have copyrighted material that you would like distributed, please 
contact either Bruce Ferrell at 853-4815, or Julie Pechersky at 853-9225 in 
Market Data, to address the issue.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Hi there,

Trying to decide where to go on your next vacation?  So am I.
Right now, there are great deals everywhere.  Florida, Mexico,
the Caribbean, Las Vegas, Hawaii, California.  All your favorite
destinations.

Now that the cold weather is on its way (there were actually
some snow flakes up north) I'm starting to remember how it was
last Winter.  Wherever I decide to go, it's going to be somewhere
WARM.  Sunny days, warm nights, moonlight walks, good times.

With prices so low, it's the perfect time to make your vacation
plans.  See the sun, have some excitement, travel with your
family and friends.  It's always a good time to travel.  And
whenever you travel, you always have a good time!

Have fun on vacation!

If Todd was unaccompanied, we would have paid o2167 p/m.  The flat he is 
occupying is o2817 p/m, difference of o650 p/m. Not sure if this is going to 
be relevant enough to the RC. We definitely could have rented the place so it 
would not have been left empty.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Sally would like to speak to you regarding the differential.  She knows that 
Todd had taken residence in accommodations left vacant by Beth Perlman.  She 
want ed more clarification on how that would be managed since it was 
utilizing an existing space. The RC she provided was Todd Hall's RC#2182.

Please can you arrange for Todd Hall, who is coming from Houston to work for 
Barry Pearce, to stay at Dolphin Square apartments? Please liaise with him 
directly on this.

We have a bit of a complicated costing situation. Barry Pearce will be taking 
the cost of the normal one bedrooms at Dolphin Square and Sally is taking the 
rest of the cost.

Jane - please provide the costs for Sally's RC.

Thanks

FYI - You may want to review the process for managing stacks on EOL and be certain that those to whom access is granted is in compliance with the list of authorized traders maintained by RAC.  I don't think that RAC needs to have approval, but we should be cross referencing requests to manage stacks on EOL with the approved trader list.  This may be part of your process.  If not, it probably should be incorporated.  Then you may want to educate the RAC team on your approval process.  Let me know if you need and help or support from me.  

Hope that all is well.  --Sally

Help!

It appears that EOL is being given out to people who have not received authorization to trade.  The latest is someone reporting up through Jean Mrha. (John Grass)  Why doesn't RAC require that anyone requesting authorization to get EOL get approved through RAC.  I'm sure Lavo doesn't know (or maybe he does) that we have yet another unauthorized trader to rein in.

Any suggestions?

Good morning. Yes, I did look at the annuity link. It looks good to me. It
is run by an insurance company. Thus, I assume there will be not only the
standard fees charged by whatever mutual fund in which you invest, but some
charge made by the ins. co. Thus, you should make certain those charges are
reasonable and defined. Additional, if the your money is actually paid by
you to the ins. co.( verses directly to the specific mutual funds) to be
invested, which I suspect is the case, then you must select a financially
strong ins.co. Do not want an Enron fiasco with this type of retirement
investment. Let me know if you have any questions. Love-Dad

Hey Dad,





Did you get the link I sent on the Def Ann?  If so, what do you think?  Is
there anything I missed?

I am still waiting on a couple of RSVPs for the bachelor party so I will let

How are things otherwise?

Can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ENA business?  I haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning.  Bob Hall and I thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and John on resignations.  SInce you have submitted that list, we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves.  

Since I haven't received the list yet, please send it to both Bob Hall and me.  I will be out of the office on Thursday, so Bob will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow.  

Thanks.  --Sally

Randy Lord with building maintenance advised us that HL&P had a switch problem that caused the Enron building to lose all commercial power. The UPS systems switched to the auxillary generators and there was minimal impact to the computer rooms and Gas Control Center during the outage. The backup chiller on the roof did not kick in automatically and building maintenance performed the switch manually. The computer rooms warmed up a bit, but not enough to be a problem. They plan to bring contractors in tomorrow morning to determine what the problem was with the backup chiller. The Gas Logistics business systems did lose one server but there was minimal to no business impact. Gas Control was not impacted. 

We will check with Randy tomorrow morning to see if HL&P has determined the root cause of their equipment failure. Let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Gary Kenagy and Scott Abshire

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

ICE Melts Resistance ToOil Swaps.
 =20
09/03/2001
PetroleumIntelligence Weekly=20
P1=20
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved=20
The oil hedging business is poised to take another step up the evolutionary=
 ladder, after the upstart IntercontinentalExchange(ICE) confirmed plans to=
 offer clearing services for its over-the-counter contracts from the fourth=
 quarter of this year. With similar moves also planned by the New York Merc=
antile Exchange (Nymex), OTC contracts such as swaps are increasingly movin=
g into the mainstream. Long regarded as the wild cousins of regulated futur=
es, OTC oil contracts were distinguished by their fuzzy legal status, lack =
of standardization, and absence of clearing services. Changes in USlaw and =
the spread of electronic trade have pretty much eroded the first two differ=
ences, and the ICE initiative will deal with the third. The main difference=
s now lie in regulation and settlement (40#02-06). ICE'sclearing services w=
ill be provided by the London Clearing House (LCH) - the clearinghouse for =
London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), which was taken over by IC=
E last month. ICE will now be able to offer a one-stop hedging shop for cle=
ared futures and derivative contracts, allowing traders to use a single loc=
ation to conduct full hedging strategies and to pool their risk. One advant=
age is that it will allow net margining between IPE Brent futures and other=
 ICE products, such as West Texas Intermediate swaps. Clearinghouses offer =
financial risk protection, acting as a central party to shield traders agai=
nst counterparty default. Derivatives trade at ICE is currently conducted b=
etween companies on the basis of bilateral credit agreements.=20
ICE'sinitiative in part reflects its increasingly fierce competition with N=
ymex. The New Yorkexchange will this week launch its new Brent crude future=
s and options contracts, as a direct challenge to the merged ICE-IPE (40#35=
-04). In return, ICE will first introduce clearing services for two activel=
y traded USproducts, involving West Texas Intermediate crude oil swaps and =
Henry Hub natural gas swaps. These swaps are the planned centerpiece for Ny=
mex'slong-delayed internet platform, eNymex(40#04-05). They also pose a pot=
ential challenge to Nymex'stwo core futures contracts, if trade migrates to=
 swaps. Some traders view swaps as more effective hedging tools. Calendar-m=
onth WTI swaps, for example, are widely used to hedge against producer or r=
efiner supply contracts, which use average prices during calendar rather th=
an contract months.=20
The evolution of swaps is also part of a deeper market trend, which has bee=
n actively encouraged by the USgovernment and some big energy companies. Th=
e UShas been working to give derivatives a stronger legal framework since t=
he late 1990s, after Russiadefaulted on its debt and the Long-Term Capital =
Management hedge fund came to the brink of collapse. That effort culminated=
 in legislation late last year giving derivatives a stronger legal footing,=
 thus eliminating the chance that parties might renege on unfavorable contr=
acts by claiming they were really unauthorized futures deals. The spread of=
 electronic trade - particularly on ICE - has accelerated the change, by en=
couraging liquid trade in standardized products. This is no accident. In an=
 interview with PIW a year ago, John Browne, chief executive of BP - one of=
 ICE'sfounders - said that the platform had been set up in an attempt to cr=
eate "a real exchange market for swaps, rather than simply one-off, over-th=
e-counter activity." This would make hedging more transparent and efficient=
, while eroding the role of intermediaries, he said. Browne drew parallels =
with the earlier evolution of interest-rate swaps in financial markets, int=
o "a standardized business." (39#27-08).Last week, ICE Chief Executive Jeff=
rey Sprechersaid the exchange wants "to try to change the way the market wo=
rks."

I am glad we finally heard from Kevin Kolb.  I would like to close the book on the stagecoach.

I will be out of the office next Wednesday through Friday.  I would like to execute the partnership documents on Monday or Tuesday, if possible.  

Sorry to hear about your wife's condition.  She will be in our prayers.

Phillip

ugg or Nuts Updated 11/24/01 Davis is scheduled to return against the Miami=
 Dolphins on Dec. 2. He has missed the past two games while recovering from=
 his second arthroscopic surgery this year.   Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Power=
s Rangers Updated 11/24/01 Gary will be out for the rest of the season. He =
broke a bone in his left leg during Thursday's game.   Darnay Scott , WR CI=
N - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable =
for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss =
the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Alle=
n , RB CHI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Al=
len will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Viki=
ngs lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Wee=
k 11.   Anthony Thomas! , RB CHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/23/01Accordi=
ng to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's gam=
e against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely =
be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL -=
 Chargers Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He ga=
ined only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for m=
ost of the second half.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/0=
1 The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list=
 Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught=
 just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.=
    James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushe=
d for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stin=
ger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained righ=
t ankle, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Damons=
 Doormats Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdow=
ns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series=
 in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch s=
aid he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His st=
atus for next week's game is uncertain.    Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at =
Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunda=
y's game at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution,=
 but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks =
in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.  =
  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven cat=
ches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also wen=
t over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best r=
eceiver in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis , RB DE=
N - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. H=
e has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  ! Olandis Gary=
  , RB DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left =
leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest o=
f the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis mig=
ht be able to return next week.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Update=
d 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump=
 against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he m=
ay catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01=
! The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis=
' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start hi=
m every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent =
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats a=
nd may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated =
11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense=
 has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner=
 Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent w=
eeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basi=
s. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, =
but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell=
 Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very we=
ll at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on t=
o open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key rece=
iver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fanat! ic! s Update=
d 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brow=
n downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brow=
n into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Door=
mats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the =
Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York =
is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative =
on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 P=
atten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has bee=
n inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. =
Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should conside=
r using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers=
 Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners th=
is season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him=
 the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints se=
condary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or N! ut! s Updated 11/21/01 Smith =
has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go u=
p against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get =
him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or=
 Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and =
we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove h=
imself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the rem=
ainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/0=
1 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few =
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues=
.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use=
 Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He =
could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak agains=
t the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 =
Gonzalez will rack up good! F! antasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. Wh=
ile he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active e=
very week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Davis ru=
shed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zon=
e once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may =
have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth =
around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Par=
ker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' sec=
ondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might=
 make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free =
Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in =
recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks o=
n Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you a=
re in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting i=

Ok, we are on.? Can you come to the Papasitos at 290 and the Beltway.? It is 
actually about 4 miles East of the beltway.? Basically if you are coming down 
290 from downtown it would be on your right about 4 miles before the Belt.? 
Let me know.

As you may know, I recently moved into Cindy Olson's organization and am responsible for our corporate responsibility initiatives, including diversity.  Andrea Yowman now reports to me and will coordinate the diversity function.  

All of you are involved in diversity, whether it is because you have participated in the Corporate Culture Committee, are responsible for supplier diversity, recruiting, compliance, etc.  We think that an ongoing coordination effort among the people invited will be critical to the success of our efforts.

I propose that we arrange a standing, one-hour meeting, initially every two weeks, to discuss overall strategy as well as individual activities that we have been involved in.  I would like for the first meeting to be held in mid-November.

I hope we can count on your participation.  Please let me know if you will be able to participate, and if so, which day and time works best from the list below:

Tuesdays:		10:00 to 11:00 a.m. OR 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.
Wednesdays:	9:00 to 10:00 a.m. OR 3:00 to 4:00 p.m.
Thursdays:		9:00 to 10:00 a.m. OR 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.

themselves. Mack has said that as well. He said he asks players what works=

for them best: whether it be the tough-love approach or the straightforward=

a couple of observations from here:
cash/futures getting whacked.  whereas last weekend cash traded $1 over G, 
this weekend will probably trade $.15 over.  the lack of weather giving the 
market time to regroup.  good thing because another week of cold and the 
system was going to break.   certainly still has that chance in feb.  saw 
utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting 
any extra demand through spot market.  in effect, they said we're not 
withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage.  they had to encourage 
marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even 
normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again.  
this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in 
mkt.  g/h getting whacked in sympathy.  
probably priced 25 term deals through broker market  and own originators in 
past two days.  24 were from the buy side.  it's as if pira came in and told 
everyone term was cheap.  however, they've got the opposite view.  customers 
just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now.  don't see any let up in 
back support for a while.  
front spreads the hardest call right now.  g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what 
to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody 
else.  almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping 
for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in 
cash.  probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less 
downside.  

doing well here.  actually having the best month ever 11 days in.  played 
front short against term length.  got out of front shorts today.   probably 
early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected.  
will keep term length meanwhile.   i've hated summer backwardation forever.  
agree about u/h.  a little less crazy about  the trade now because i think 
the easy money was made over the past two days.  unbelievable spec demand for 
next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and 
crushed on move down.  jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front 
virtually unchanged.

don't know what to think of this summer longer term.  certainly not as easy 
as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas.  
now $6 for this summer, i don't know.  we're gonna have to inject the hell 
out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.  but we will feel 
production increase hit the market.  just buy vol.

im getting really bullish mar/may-deliverabulty ayt these propective stx gonna
be hampered big time-thyre expensive but im not sure the mkt has a feeling for
what gas can do yet with normal weather and implications on the economy-as a
real estate owner getting a little scared. ngas is going to wreck morot 
gasoline
now-watch it go next then maybe heating oil

you doing alrite?

FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my 
promotion memo from Energy Operations.  I believe that they both work under 
Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.  I am sure that they didn't mind having 
their names included twice in promotional memos!  

Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she 
wondered if I would be coming.  I will be in South America in what should be 
summer there.  I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.  In addition to 
other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in 
Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.  I hosted a 
happy hour in Houston for Energy Operations employees who were promoted last 
week, and I wanted to do the same thing for the three in Calgary.

I do not know if you are looking for anyone right now in your group, but attached is the resume of a woman I used to work with at American General Corporation ("AGC").  She was an excellent business person.  I worked with her on private placement transactions.  One of the responsibilities of a private placement analyst at AGC was credit analysis.  If I can answer any questions about her let me know.  The only reason she is currently looking is because of the possible job losses following the acquisition of AGC by AIG.

Subject: Confidential Folder to safely pass information to  Arthur Andersen


We have become increasingly concerned about confidential information 
(dpr/position info, curves, validations/stress tests, etc) being passed to 
Arthur Andersen for audit purposes over the Web to their Arthur Andersen 
email addresses. (necessary now they no longer have access to Enron's 
internal email system)  

Please use the folder described below when passing any info (that you would 
have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party) via the shared 
drive that has been set up for this specific purpose.   

Note:  AA should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are 
questions, or the data needs updating.  We should also consider the 
sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being 
distributed electronically.


Please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info 
back and forth.

 
Details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info:

A secured folder has been set up on the "o" drive under Corporate called 
Arthur_Andersen (O:\Corporate\Arthur_Anderson).  Please post all confidential 
files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email 
address.  If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the 
IT Central site: http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/.  
Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their 
terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

Please contact Vanessa Schulte if you have any problems or questions

Mr. Hall,
I have just reviewed the Merchant Portfolio Summary for 6/20 and have the 
following questions:
 1) CALME shows an asset of $291.9MM  and APACHI shows an asset of $113.0MM 
and they show no p&l for the year
  Is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums 
and commodity prices?
 2) India recently invested in an IPO (rediff.com) for which there was a 
simultaneous DASH to buy and sell (sounds like a Merchant deal).
  Where does this show up?
 3) There are several bonds (publicly traded, registrered securities, housed 
in our Prime Broker accounts) owned by various Enron entities
  that I do not believe are on the DPR.  Shouldn't they be? And if so, who is 
deciding not to include?
Pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do.
Thanks
Ted

Mike,

I spoke with Steve Sweeney at Cogentrix today regarding this spreadsheet, and he would like to see our data for every day from June 1, 2001 through September 30, 2001 as you calculated for the few random days throughout the summer.  The spreadsheet seems to indicate that we did not allocate Cogentrix on some of the days in question.  This information is contrary to the information Steve provided and must be explored further. 

Steve is getting impatient with this process.  He would like to see this come to a resolution as soon as possible.  I said that I understand his concern and we will do our best to resolve this in a timely matter.  

Kent, once Mike finishes the spreadsheet, I recommend that we meet and discuss our offer to Cogentrix.

Just a question as to whether Dynegy has been notified that we are amending the contracts of these guys to delete minimum or target bonus and replacing with performance bonus memo?  We may want to send a brief email confirming the discussions and their consent so that we have it for our files.

Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for hosting a brown bag lunch session yesterday; your presentation 
was very informative and I believe it led to greater understanding of 
Business Development within GSS.  On a personal level, I was very interested 
in your Continental deal and would like to read a white paper or postmortems 
analysis of the deal after it closes.

I also thank you for taking an active role in this mornings' brown bag, I 
felt like it lent additional credibility to Experience Enron and answered the 
inevitable "what's in it for me" questions.

Sincerely,
Jim Wininger

	Ladies & Gentlemen:

	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

	I appreciate your patience.	

	Many thanks.

	Britt

Rick,
As follow-up to our discussion of today, we would like to explain our concerns.
EEL entities are under control of an administrator - Price Waterhouse - who represents the interest of the creditors of those entities.
All decisions regarding those entities are being made by the administrator.  Michael Brown, Fernley Dyson, John Sherriff are not in the building and to the best of my knowledge have resigned all directorships.
Most of the remaining employees (300) are working for the administrator.  
There are, however, interests of Enron Corp which are housed in Enron House may not be getting the attention they deserve or , potentially more concerning, are being used or eyed by the locals for their benefit.

Examples are :
1) the contractual assets in ECTRIC which include financial trades, weather derivatives, nordic energy, some crude and products trading.
2) large in the money pumped storage trade which is in a US-based LLC - in the money by a net $50MM
3) Enron Direct is being offered for sale (JV with EES)
4) The TXU VPS contracts (currently under termination dispute) is being negotiated solely by administrators and their employees

Transactions are being terminated by counterparties, deals are being cut between the administrators and commercial for the dispostion of assets, and value is being eroded because no support staff will work without a reasonable expectation of being paid.  Finally, the administrators have been here for several weeks and seem woefully prepared to take on the task at hand.

We suggest that the Houston-based 'investor' (whether that is current managment or a trustee) ought to reconstitute some form of governance over its activities in Europe so that it can be assured of receiving maximum value for its assets here.  

Currently, we have little capability to cause the local staff to provide us with the information and access to make informed decisions.

Please give us a call so we can discuss a course of action, if any, you would like us to take.

Ted

Attached for your review and input are initial cuts at the schedules for the 
draft P & S Agreement that we will be discussing on our call tomorrow 
morning.  You'll see that in many places the drafts are simply placeholders 
for information that some of you will need to provide, but hopefully they 
provide a useful starting point.  I  cannot overstate the importance of the 
schedules.  They have a direct impact upon the representations that ENA will 
be making to a potential purchaser and any errors in the schedules can result 
in serious financial liability for the company.

We need to have our schedules for Pastoria ready for posting on DealBench by 
the end of this week.

Thanks for your continued efforts.  I look forward to talking with you 
tomorrow.

 Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of=

 Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He =

 James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's=
=20
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.=
=20
"The team got together and discussed some things," said Posey, "and=20

night of production from some of their Denver players.  =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The=

Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right kne=

Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for=

neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.  =20

 Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left=20
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.=
=20
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how=20
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. "The=20
shoulder's still attached to my body," said Henderson. "No question I'll=20
play."  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one o=

Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about=

Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he i=

smart move. =20

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Haw=
ks=20
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where h=

has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of=20
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more=20
natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's=20
leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth=

roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid=

replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=

surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=

alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.  =

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=

per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. =20

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter afte=

aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coac=

Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.=

Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once=

again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00=20
 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a=
=20
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds=
=20
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the=20
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury =
-=20
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their=
=20
lineup.   =20

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =

 Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for=20
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if=20
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of=

his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if=

possible.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =
=20
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=
c.=20
20 "at the latest".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up=
. =20
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=

played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=

lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a "leave" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =

seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20

  Yes, we can!!  My Bible Study starts at 5pm. I have an hour!  We may change 
the Bible Study to an earlier time though due to the Super Bowl and then I 
will have more than an hour. Either way...I know I will be there.  Please 
know I am praying for you for strength and perseverance as you contine to be 
with Enron. I am sure things are not really comfortable right now but I sure 
am glad they have a wonderful light of Christ's witness like you to be among 
all the darkness.  My heart is still mourning the gentleman who ended his 
life. I pray there will be no one else. Alina grows in leaps and bounds each 
day. I see her at ACEC and she is pure delight. She yells a greeting to me 
when she sees me and it lights up my heart.  I am not sure what she is saying 
but we know each other and it really thrills me to see her smile and her 
little hand waving.  She is such a blessing!  Everyone shows her so much 
love. At Sunday school last week we all really gave Chad encouragment and 
affirmation that he is now the big brother.  He seemed pleased and a wee bit 
shy about all the attention.  Hope and pray we were not toooo much for him.  
Shelly, if you ever get stuck for someone to keep the kids for a while...I 
would be honored if my schedule permits.  Just wanted you to know! 
Thanks for all you do and are doing! I can't wait to begin beating the drum 
for VBS.
In Him,
Patty

marketrelations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants

Many Market Participants recognized the mismatch in prices which were posted 
on
the NYISO website versus those which were used for billing in the settlement
statements.

The NYISO has identified the various differences and has modified software
necessary to update and / or correct the prices associated with the categories
listed below;

Upon completion of all the Historical LBMP updates noted below, the NYISO will
recompute and post new real time weighted files.  Information on what 
intervals
have been changed, as a result of a specific issue noted below, will be
provided.

Issue #1:  Prices and Postings During Reserve Pickup Intervals:
During instances where the dispatch interval is in response to a  Reserve 
Pickup
request, the price which will be used to bill a Reserve Pickup (RPU)  period 
is
the price associated with the most recent normal SCD execution interval
preceding the reserve pickup interval. There were limited instances during the
first 11 months of operation where an LBMP was incorrectly calculated and 
posted
for the reserve pickup intervals.

Solution Issue #1:  For the period 11/99 until the present, all RPU intervals
that were inadvertently posted with price calculations based on the reserve
pickup intervals will be replaced with the price from the dispatch cycle
immediately preceding the reserve pickup.  Any modifications made which result
in changes to the billing data will be corrected through the re-bill and 
true-up
process in future months.


Issue #2:  Posted Price Discrepancies Between Proxy Bus and Load Bus Prices:
During the process of correcting and reposting prices, the Generator or proxy
bus prices were updated, but not the Zonal or load prices.

Solution Issue #2: ALL proxy gen prices which are different from their
corresponding zonal prices, will be copied into the zonal bus prices to
overwrite any possible discrepancies between these two files, as these should 
be
identical. NOTE: The Billing & Accounting System (BAS) was coded to use the
generator proxy bus price.  Therefore the BAS calculations have been 
consistent
with the generator proxy price and should not affect any bills.


Issue #3:  Missing SCD Intervals In Pass of Data Between SCD and PTS- Due to
Loss of Communications:
At times there periods exist when communication links between operating 
systems,
namely SCD and Performance Tracking (PTS) in this case, have failed and have 
to
be manually reactivated.  During these sub-system failure periods, SCD 
intervals
are being saved and when communications are restored or through the price
correction process the SCD intervals are restored.  During these failure 
periods
the SCD Start/Stop signals are not being transferred to the PTS. Six-second
actual data continues to be received by PTS during these failure periods.  PTS
develops an average actual value over the SCD interval periods. During the
failure periods the PTS observations do not match the number of SCD interval
observations. The BAS is coded to ignore any intervals where there is not a
match between the price file and the metered MW files. For example, if SCD had
intervals for :05, :10 and :15 and the PTS integrated actuals covered the 
period
:05 - :15 then the BAS would calculate the billing based on the consistent 
sets
of data, The interval then becomes a 10 minute interval.

Solution Issue #3 The system will be programmed such that it will recognize 
when
an interval is missing in PTS and the PTS interval will be generated by
splitting the large interval,  with the assumption that the energy was 
delivered
uniformly over the entire interval.   Retroactive to Nov'99, the missing
intervals will be created.  Through the monthly rebill and true-up process,
these intervals will be used and billing results may change as a result.

Issue #4:  Dispatch Interval Type "R"
When SCD is in a reserve pickup, and the pick-up is unsuccessful after 10
minutes, an extra PTS interval is generated for performance tracking of units.
This interval is not an actual interval where basepoints are calculated and 
sent
to generators.  At the time the PTS intervals are sent to the MIS, an LBMP
interval is also sent.    These intervals were posted on the OASIS and then
ignored in BAS.

Solution Issue #4 Retroactively to Nov'99, all LBMP intervals generated as 
part
of the reserve pickup performance tracking process will be deleted.  In the
future, the intervals will not be sent to MIS for posting.

Issue #5:  Consistent Updated Price Postings
Prior to January 2000, intervals updated as part of price corrections were
posted to a different spot on the OASIS in a different format,  thus making it
difficult for market participants to locate the correct data.

Solution Issue #5 Retroactively to Nov'99, an update of the current LBMP 
posting
files will be accomplished to include the price corrections not originally
posted.


The intent of the NYISO is to have all corrections for retroactive price 
posting
discrepancies, and software enhancements completed by the end of Nov 2000.

Hello everyone,

Attached is a summary write-up I've prepared on the EIP Plan (it's origin, current status and why we feel it s/b terminated) to deliver to Mary Joyce for her conversation with Mark Frevert.  I felt it a good idea to summarize all on one piece of papaer  in case Marke Frevert was not familar with the Plan.  This Plan is pretty intense when even intimate with it's details!

Sheila/Michelle, could you pls. both review prior to me delivering to Mary to see if I've missed anything or am describing anything incorrectly.  Pam is out today.  I appreciate it.  After your review I'll deliver.  I feel it's going to be very critical to get Mark's support on this to take it to the "termination" level, so I want this to go smoothly.

I'm also going to dabble around with a few "settlement payout" scenarios, based on the actual fund size, original expectations, remaining participants, etc.  I'll send to you for review and we'll have in our back pocket when it's time to talk to Gene.

Thanks all!

Susan

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

BRUSSELS, Aug. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The lowest spot prices have all but disappeared from the European market, although there is little buying activity at all as the vacation season shifts from northern to southern Europe. Unsolicited spot offers are a reducing feature of European pulp buyers' lives.
Pulpex futures prices have crept up in the past two weeks. When Pulpex prices move away from spot prices, this tends to indicate the direction to be expected for spot price movement. Certain short fiber producers from South America are reported to have abandoned the Italian market temporarily as price demands in the country have hit lows that these suppliers are not prepared to entertain.

Subject:	United Parcel Service (UPS) Letter Centers Now Open

As part of the recently negotiated agreement with United Parcel Service (UPS), Enron employees may now utilize two new letter centers when sending packages after hours.  These letter centers are located in Three Allen Center, on the ground level, behind the down escalator, near the U.S. Postal Services self-service area and in the Enron Building, at the back of the escalators near the automated teller machine.  

Letter-sized envelopes, as well as boxes up to 18"x 13" x 3" can be shipped via Next-Day Air, Second-Day Air, Third-Day Select, UPS International and UPS World-Wide Express Service.  

In order to eliminate service disruptions, please apply a completed label to the envelope or box, in accordance with previously communicated shipping instructions.  When utilizing the shipping documentation available at the letter center, please include the Enron account number and your company code and cost center in the reference fields.  

Pick up times at the letter centers are 7:45 p.m. for Three Allen Center and 8:00 p.m. for the Enron Building, Monday through Friday.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Glenn Lewis, Global Strategic Sourcing contract manager at 713-646-7512.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

John - Diomedes disagrees with the assessment that the $315,833.30 payment under Section 4(b)(i) should not be paid.  See below.
 
Kent- I relayed to Diomedes that the Employment Agreement payment with respect to the 2000 IPB calculates to $0 payment.  Diomedes wants to see the accounting data.  Do you want to provide to him?
 
I am working on the finalization of the other payments and have indicated as such to Diomedes.

Subject: ECI Payment


Dear Pam,
 
Based on our conversation earlier today I thought it may be easier if I send this email clarifying the points in the agreement relevant to the disputed ECI payment.
 
I understood that the position taken by Luiz Watanabe is that no payment is currently due under clause 4(b)(i) of the Buyout Agreement because the Rio de Janeiro Project is a merchant project and as such it has no PPA.
 
This is an incorrect interpretation because Clause 4(b)(i) states that the the payment is due upon the EARLIER of the PPA signature date OR the Project PAYMENT date. If you then look at the definition of "SP/RJ Project Payment Date" on page 7 it tells you that it is the FIRST to occur of "Financial Closing" or "COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION". And, finally, if you go to the definition of "Commencement of Construction" on page 4 it tells you that it occurs when at least 10% of the payments to contractors have been made. This payment in other words is due many months ago as the project is now 100% complete.
 
If you can confirm this by tomorrow please include it in the payment otherwise proceed with whatever payment has been approved and we can do this one over the next couple of days.
 
Finally, regarding to the Employment Agreement payments I will need, as per our agreement, to have access to the accounting data used to determine the IPP Bonus. I think the best way is for me and my accountants to be provided with the name of an Enron accountant who has the data and authority to discuss them with us so that we can address any issues.
 
Thanks and look forward to hearing from you,
 
Diomedes.

Hey Lynn!  Lunch sounds great.  However, I'm off tomorrow - I'm going on a little retreat with my mom.  And then on Thursday, I'm having lunch with my new boss!  Maybe we could grab a coffee on Thursday afternoon.  I'll call you.  I hope you're not feeling the pain!

Subject: Various Items

1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John 
Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft 
now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he 
made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, 
meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive 
those drafts today.  

2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply 
to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was 
asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am 
there.    

3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are 
the following:

Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide 
for you during this transition period
Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of 
the details on having support personnel in London 

Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for 
Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one 
(which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)

Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is 
appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective 
trading operations and controls world-wide

I look forward to seeing you next week.

Subject: SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES

  
DJ Southwest Power Pool To Study 6 New Transmission Lines 
Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--A working group within the Southwest Power Pool 
identified six new transmission lines with an estimated price tag of $240 
million needed to ease the region's constrained high-voltage grid. 
     Last week, the SPP work group voted to proceed with a more detailed 
analysis of each project. Most of the new lines would take at least three 
years to develop and build. 
     The projects include: 
     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the 
Fairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. 
     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek 
Nuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner 
Power Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma 
connecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 
million. 
     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power 
Station to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. 
     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis 
Power station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. 
     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify 
needed system upgrades since March 2000. 
     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade 
options were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer 
capability. 
     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most 
beneficial, officials said. 
     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be 
made to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. 
     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests 
more than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the 
next three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John 
Marschewski. 
     "As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines," he said. 
     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission 
organization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to 
coordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. 
     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests 
from utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages 
occur, said Marschewski. 
     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market 
to encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, "those options 
haven't been exercised to any significant amount so far," said Marschewski. 
     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, 
but if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he 
said. 
     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New 
Mexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas.

We have become increasingly concerned about confidential information 
(dpr/position info, curves, validations/stress tests, etc) being passed to 
Arthur Andersen for audit purposes over the Web to their Arthur Andersen 
email addresses. (necessary now they no longer have access to Enron's 
internal email system)  

Please use the folder described below when passing any info (that you would 
have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party) via the shared 
drive that has been set up for this specific purpose.   

Note:  AA should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are 
questions, or the data needs updating.  We should also consider the 
sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being 
distributed electronically.


Please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info 
back and forth.

 
Details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info:

A secured folder has been set up on the "o" drive under Corporate called 
Arthur_Andersen (O:\Corporate\Arthur_Anderson).  Please post all confidential 
files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email 
address.  If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the 
IT Central site: http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/.  
Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their 
terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

Please contact Vanessa Schulte if you have any problems or questions

	Ladies & Gentlemen:

	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

	I appreciate your patience.	

	Many thanks.

	Britt

Subject:	HR Warehouse 

Hello everyone!
The purpose of this e-mail is to tell you about a new program which we are rolling out that will benefit the ENTIRE ENRON HR COMMUNITY.
It is called the HR Warehouse.
It is a collection of folders located on the O Drive  which have been set up to increase communication between the various BUs' HR groups.
The idea was born out of our experiences in the HR Forum, where various members of the Enron HR community would share ideas, goings on, etc.
The primary goal is to increase efficiency.  Why re-create the wheel when it is already on the road elsewhere?
We all have a variety of programs, processes, forms, etc. which we use in our daily work life.
Through this repository, you can now share your ideas with others, and put their ideas to work for you.
Also, there is a parking lot for HR related questions, where you will be able to get answers/ advice for whatever problems/ issues you are dealing with.
The document below is the framework for this program.
The only way this will be effective, however, is for people to use it!
I am in the process of setting up security access for these folders, and need your assistance.
Can you please e-mail me a list of EE's who you feel would benefit from the HR Warehouse (actually, everyone could, but we need to restrict access!).
Also, if you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know. 
Thank you!

Sunjay

2. Crisis and Ratcheting Up Government Growth
3. De-politicizing the Final Choice

-------------------------------------------------------------

PHONY STIMULUS PACKAGE WON'T FIX THE ECONOMY

"Although understandably preoccupied with the war on terrorism, the 
Bush administration needs to give some leadership to the economy. 
This means recognizing its own mistakes," writes Independent 
Institute research fellow Paul Craig Roberts, in a recent syndicated 
column.

For starters, Bush should recognize that his tax cuts -- which are 
phased-in and temporary rather than immediate and permanent -- will 
do little to stimulate investment. Furthermore, the pork-barrel 
spending package "is not a stimulus; it simply crowds out an 
equivalent amount of private spending and prevents resources from 
being used more productively," writes Roberts.

As Roberts says, the so-called "stimulus" package ignores the lessons 
for stimulating long-term growth taught by supply-side economics 
twenty years ago.

"The solution to the economy's problems is obvious and simple," 
Roberts argues. "Effective immediately, abolish the alternative 
minimum tax, accelerate depreciation on a permanent basis and cut tax 
rates on personal income."

Really Happened in 1981," by Alan Reynolds and Paul Craig Roberts

-------------------------------------------------------------

CRISIS AND RATCHETING UP GOVERNMENT GROWTH

The wasteful pork in the recent spending package, and the dubious new 
anti-privacy powers of the federal government, illustrate clearly how 
government grows during national crises. Less obvious, however, is 
the fact that when the emergencies subside, the new programs are 
seldom dissolved. Often they are transformed into new programs or 
agencies with new missions, ratcheting up government's growth.

The International Monetary Fund is one of thousands of examples that 
could illuminate this government pathology, explain Independent 
Institute research fellow Steve Hanke and senior fellow Robert Higgs 
in a new op-ed for the FINANCIAL TIMES.

Formed in 1944 as part of the Bretton Woods agreement, the IMF was 
intended to stabilize the global financial system -- by providing 
credit to countries experiencing balance-of-payments problems under 
the postwar pegged-exchange-rate system. But when President Nixon 
closed the U.S. gold window in 1971 -- effectively ending the Bretton 
Woods agreement -- the IMF became a multi-million dollar agency in 
search of a new mission.

It soon found one. The IMF reinvented itself during the oil shocks of 
the 1970s, and in the 1980s, with President Reagan's seal of 
approval, by subsidizing loans to developing countries.

Today, the IMF is contemplating ways to financially assist coalition 
partners in the War against Terrorism and to deny funds to 
less-than-cooperative countries.

Government programs and institutions aren't the only things that get 
ratcheted-up during national crises.

"The ratchet continues to operate on ideology, too," write Hanke and 
Higgs. "A recent poll conducted by THE WASHINGTON POST indicates that 
53 percent of Americans think the government 'is run for the benefit 
of all the people,' up from 35 percent last year. Only 37 percent 
agreed that 'the government is pretty much run by a few big interests 
looking out for themselves,' the lowest percentage since 1966, when 
33 percent embraced that view.

"It may be too much to expect a speedy end to the law of the ratchet, 
but it is time to acknowledge what is going on. That, at least, may 
make it easier to reverse the trend during times of stability."

-------------------------------------------------------------

DE-POLITICIZING THE FINAL CHOICE

One of the most dramatic battles between federal and state 
governments -- and a painful illustration of how drug prohibition 
cripples human dignity -- is brewing in Oregon, where a federal judge 
recently issued a court order to block U.S. Attorney General John 
Ashcroft from interfering with the state's physician-assisted suicide 
law.

(Declaring that physician-assisted suicide "was not a legitimate 
medical purpose for prescribing drugs," Ashcroft -- who earier had 
promised to uphold federalism over federal encroachment upon the 
states -- had threatened to have the medical licenses of 
participating doctors revoked.)

Many civil libertarians, understandably, see Ashcroft's threat as a 
direct assault on human dignity in a matter too private and sensitive 
to allow government interference between doctor and patient.

However, according to psychiatrist Thomas Szasz (member, Independent 
Institute Board of Advisors), the fundamental problem is that our 
laws make it unlawful to use lethal drugs to commit suicide -- 
except, as in the case of Oregon, when it is physician-assisted, and 
even then only under limited circumstances.

In other words, no matter how painfully one may suffer from a 
terminal illness, one's ultimate choice must be prescribed by a 
physician.

Undoubtedly, this needlessly prolongs the suffering and anguish of 
those law-abiding sufferers who decide that waiting for nature to 
take its course is too long and too painful.

Drug and suicide law reform, however, would help restore genuine 
dignity to those suffering from unspeakable pain. "Physician-assisted 
suicide," writes Szasz in a new op-ed, "is but one of the 
consequences of our drug laws."

By expanding their range of lawful options, drug and suicide law 
reform would enable the terminally ill to take matters lawfully into 
their own hands without interference from the state. It would also 
help lift the burden from physicians struggling to interpret the 
Hippocratic Oath.

"The American people are ceaselessly propagandized about the real 
dangers from which drug prohibitions are intended to protect us," 
Szasz concludes. "The damage the prohibitions cause are glossed over 
in silence or, more often, are unrecognized. We avoid confronting 
problems of living as moral problems and choose instead to treat them 
as medical problems. It is not a good choice."

ANGELES TIMES, 11/23/01), at

UPDATE ON INTER-SC TRADES ADJUSTMENT BID PROJECT TIMELINE
Market Participants:

Market Participants, through TSWG,  have expressed concern about the
currently scheduled release time between 10 minute settlements and Inter-SC
Trade Adjustment Bid functionality.  As a result of the delay to
implementation of 10 minute settlements, the release time frame has
decreased from the original 1 month to approximately 2 weeks.  Understanding
these timing concerns, the ISO has decided to delay the implementation of
Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid.

Therefore, the ISO is revising the implementation target date for Inter-SC
Trade Adjustment Bid until the first week of October 1, 2000.  Following is
an updated project timeline.

Prior to the ISO making this decision, feedback from both business and
technical sides of the Market Participants were taken into consideration.
It was determined that this later date will allow Market Participants
additional testing time to prepare for a successful implementation of the
Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid software.

Lynn,
Any luck getting a copy of that July Bushton report for me?  It was the one that showed who was scheduled at Bushton with Rate Schedule data so we could see who was flowing interruptible either from a receipt point to the inlet to Bushton or from the outlet to Demarc.

Subject:	Questions on MDQ 

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

SINGAPORE, Aug. 20, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The Japanese giant, Oji Paper, has unveiled plans to add almost 1 million tonnes/yr of paper and board capacity in Asia, outside of Japan, by March 2006 at a total investment cost of Yen 150 billion ($1.2 billion). The group aims to carry out the ambitious expansion scheme through building greenfield mills or via mergers and acquisitions.
Oji has already taken the first step in the project. The group raised its stake in Japan Brazil Paper and Pulp Resources Development Company (JBP) in July to become the largest shareholder. JBP is a Japanese consortium that took over Brazil's Celulose Nipo-Brasileira (CENIBRA) last month, which has a bleached eucalyptus pulp capacity of 820,000 tonnes/yr. Oji shelled out Yen 18 billion for the additional JBP shares and plans to use the extra 250,000 tonnes/yr of pulp from CENIBRA to cater for its Asian expansions, according to Oji's spokesman, Takao Ito. 
Oji has set up a special unit, Asian Research Center, to promote the expansion scheme. The project team reports directly to Oji's new president, Shoichiro Suzuki, a senior engineer who assumed the top post in late June. Suzuki said in July that Oji aims to be an Asian group led from Japan and that Thailand and China are top priorities in its portfolio, according to Ito. He added that Oji's investment targets also include Indonesia and Vietnam. 
Oji's 1 million tonne/yr expansion goal includes building a large PM that has an uncoated and coated woodfree capacity of 500,000 tonnes/yr. The remainder of the 1 million tonne/yr capacity target will include 200,000 tonnes/yr of newsprint or lightweight coated paper, 150,000 tonnes/yr of board and 150,000 tonnes/yr of specialty grades used for communication papers. 
Oji will fund its Asian expansion projects through increased sales and its ongoing corporate restructuring program. The group aims to cut its workforce by 2,200 to 20,900 by March 2004. "We have reduced staff, paid off debts and reorganized group companies," Ito indicated. Oji expects to save Yen 8 billion/yr from workforce retrenchment and Yen 3 billion/yr through streamlining production. 
"We see the plan as realistic and thought-out," said two analysts at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney, Peter Cain and Paul Blamire, in a recent report. They estimated that Oji's scheme suggested a cost of $1,200/tonne, which is comparable to the reported cost of some projects in Asia in recent years. "In Japan, the most recent major capacity addition, Hokuetsu Paper's PM 8 at [the] Niigata [mill], cost approximately $1,825/tonne," the report continued. 
"Oji aims not to add substantial net capacity in Japan as it expands in Asia. This strategy gives it the option of producing locally for Asian markets or importing back to Japan if demand justifies," the report added. On top of that, the analysts believe that Oji's increased stake in CENIBRA was a sensible move "since it avoids dependence on Indonesian pulp". 
Oji has not yet announced any specific project under the Asian expansion scheme. But Suzuki revealed in July that Oji would not consider acquiring any of Asia Pulp & Paper's assets this year due to its complex debt issues, or making any investments in Indonesia given the country's political and economic uncertainty, Ito said. 
Cain believes that the most likely move for Oji is the expansion of its operations in Thailand. The group has a mill in Prachinburi which operates a 30,000 tonne/yr carbonless copy paper PM. The mill site has ample space for future growth and is adjacent to Advance Agro's (AA) plantation land. Cain pointed out that Oji owns a 5.5 percent stake in AA, but said Oji is unlikely to raise its stake in the joint venture which is still carrying out a debt restructuring program. Another factor in the country's favor is that, according to Ito, the production cost is 10 percent lower in Thailand than in Japan. 
Cain suggested that Oji may expand its newsprint and boxboard operations in Asia, rather than other grades where the market is already saturated. Japan imports around 60,000 tonnes/yr of newsprint, which means Oji could fill this gap. In addition, Oji is very good at producing high-quality boxboard, while Asian markets still rely a lot on imports, he added. 
As for Oji's plan to invest in a 500,000 tonne/yr coated and uncoated woodfree PM, Cain said that the group could install the unit in China but that it is not really viable. China is facing overcapacity in these grades in the near future due to a flurry of new capacity due to come online. On top of that, Stora Enso filed an application with the Chinese government for the approval of a scheme to invest in a 500,000 tonne/yr coated woodfree PM late last year. The project is still at the pre-planning stage though and the approval process can take three years or more. Ito admitted that Oji has not yet submitted any expansion proposals to the authorities.

I'd like to get together as a group and discuss both Commodity Logic & DCAF 
projects and see if we can put together a joint high level vision for 
supporting the trade clearing functions.  Here are the items I'd like to 
initially discuss:

Commodity Logic Deliverables, timing and perhaps a demo or screen shots to 
show where we currently are in our development.
Current DCAF requests and current areas of pain communicated from the user 
side.
Legal & Credit concerns or issues known at this time.

Once we have put together a strawman or high level plan then let's follow up 
with the larger user community and see if this address the highest priority 
concerns that were brought up at the Deal Clearing JAD session. 

 Cheryl:  Please set up an hour and a half meeting with the people addressed 
under cc: above to discuss the subject listed above.  I'd like to meet ASAP 
and would be willing to buy lunch if that aids us in getting this scheduled 
sooner than later.

Dear Warriors,

Below I have included a link that I think many of you will find interesting.  It's a short article primarily about energy.  More importantly however, it's a great real-world example of how correlations, regressions and trend analysis among commodities and macro-indicators yield valuable insights.  It's proof that what we do matters!

Thanks!
Vikram

Louise Kitchen/John Lavorato have requested that each of you prepare a brief one page summary highlighting your accomplishments for this review period by end of day Friday, June 29, 2001.  

You may use the PEP system and do a self-evaluation (let me know if you need assistance w/this) or send me an email bullet pointing your accomplishments.  If you have already done a self-eval, you do not need to respond to this email.  HR is compiling the information for OOTC and I appreciate your assistance/timely response.  I apologize for the quick turn around-just got the request myself.

Please call or email w/any questions.  Thanks.

Thanks, Alan.  I just got off the phone with the other candidate, Donald
Duncan, and he, too, appears strong.  Donald has been an in-house energy
lawyer in Houston for 24 years, most recently with Eagle Global Logistics
(EGL), an international freight forwarder, which he left in May.  EGL is
suffering severe financial problems which comes as no surprise since their
principal client base are the computer manufacturers and tech companies that
have all suffered dramatic losses over the past 3-5 quarters.

Notably, Donald spent 9 years with Pennzoil's mining business and, as such,
is intimately familiar with the coal industry.  He also worked on a major
coal seam degasification project for Sonat in the '80s in the Black Warrior
Basin of Alabama.

Donald has the advantage of being familiar with both the coal and freight
industries and of being already in Houston.  He is very interested in you
and, as with Jerry Prager, let me encourage you to call him directly if you
are interested in speaking with him.  He is available anytime after 2:00
p.m. today and anytime tomorrow morning.  He can be reached at 713.515.4863.

Of course, if you are interested in additional information, please feel free
to give me a call.  Best regards,

Lee Allbritton

Unfortunately, I do not think we'll have time for this today, given other critical priorities.  I would suggest that the deadline may be slipping in light of other activities.

ADM Power Portfolio Evaluation

Market Conditions:

Ratings (#1 Best)
1.  Decatur, IL (IP Control Area  = CA)
2.  Southport, NC (CP&L CA)
3.  Clinton, IA and Cedar Rapids, IA (Alliant CA)
4.  Peoria, IL (CILCO CA)
5.  Des Moines, IA (MEC CA)

The most desirable ADM facility is the Decatur, IL plant, in regards to market conditions, some of which are:
1.  Dynegy/IP are trading an IP-TVA,AMRN,CEAEP,MEC hourly physical product online @ DynegyDirect.com
2.  IP CA has 8 Direct connects to other utilities(UT), 5 of which are very desirable e.g.. TVA, AEP, AMRN, MEC, CE.
3.  Several smaller UTs in the general area, this is a benefit due to their propensity to be short/long small and non-standard quantities.

The facilities in CP&L is rated 2 due to excess mw levels and location.  SERC is a prime market area due to it is net short during peak periods under gas generation.  The next most desirable facilities are the Clinton & Cedar Rapids which are both connected to the ALT CA.  The major advantage is the accessibility to the MAPP area due to its abundance of cheap base load power.  ALT is on the border of both the MAPP area (good cheap supply) and MAIN (good supply & demand.)  The peoria plant is farther down on the scale due to CILCO few interconnects AMRN, IP, CWL&P and CE, these are good major interconnects , however, the CILCO CA is very small.  The lowest ranked facility in ADM's portfolio is the Des Moines plant is located in the MEC CA. The MEC CA is located on the border of MAIN & MAPP which has benefits, but , the major hurdle is the small load and generation levels.  Small amounts are very difficult to supply and market.

Transmission by CA:

Ratings:
1.  CP&L  = Ample amounts of transmission, limited congestion problems.
2.  IP = Good levels of available trans. some congestion problems.
3.  ALT = Acceptable levels of ATC, some congestion problems.
4.  CILCO = Ample ATC for small CA size.  Fewer interconnects than others.
5.  MEC = Limited ATC and congestions difficulties.


Please contact me with any questions or additional information.

Don,

As we discussed, can you please provide some comments on each of the ADM locations listed on the attachment below.  Some thoughts on the difficulty of moving power in each area (ie transmission availability) as well as the general market conditions and opportunities in each would be helpful.  Also, any comments on how difficult the utility involved is to deal with would be good.  The intention is to pick one or more sites for a trial management deal with ADM.

Thanks,

Tom.

Bret:

Thanks again for taking time to meet with Tom May, Terri Clynes and me
regarding Enron's power services products on June 27.

I would like to firm a date for our follow up meeting. We had discussed
your coming to Houston to meet at our office on Tuesday
July 24. Does that date work for you ? I would propose flying down the
night before. We could meet in the morning then play golf in
the afternoon followed by dinner at Cafe Annie (one of Houston's best).
Alternatively, you could fly down Tuesday morning for an
afternoon meeting followed by dinner, cigars, etc. Let me know what
works best.

In addition, we had discussed 6 facilities to look at for potential
services trials. They were Southport, Peoria, Clinton, Cedar Rapids,
Decatur and Des Moines. Can you provide the following information by
facility:

1. plant demand
2. generation capability
3. utility tariff facility is under
4. does facility have an interconnect agreement
5.    "       "        "    real-time metering
6. what is the voltage level of the interconnection

If you could provide this information in advance of the July 24 meeting,
we can perform some critical initial due diligence. Let me know
if the July 24 date works for you.


Regards,   Ed

Per last week's call, I am circulating updated FERC staff talking points to the entire Western Wholesale group.  This version of the talking points incorporates comments from Steffes, Walton, and Perrino.

Phillip Allen: people on the call were wondering if there are any informal messages the West gas desk would like to relay to FERC staff. Notes, however, that ex parte contacts such as these generally must avoid issues that are being currently litigated by the FERC.

Hey crew,

In the midst of all the uncertainty going on with our credit issues and the Big E, a situation might arise in the near future (today forward)  when our counterparties default on their obligations to EPMI. The heads of the desk have requested that the hourly group monitor these defaults in a timely manner and report instances to our credit dept ASAP.

This is an example of what might occur and how we should handle the situation:

DETM has a preschedule with us that they are obligated to deliver 50 MW 7-22. They will call EPMI and say we are not going to deliver the power due to the fact of EPMI's credit issues. If this call occurs, we are then short to our downstream, and must notify that counterparty that they will not be receiving the power because our upstream is not delivering the power and our downstream can pass Firm LD's upstream. 

Before we let DETM off the phone, we must get some information from them: First, note the name, time, schedule, tag involved, and also tell them they need to send a fax stating DETM is not agreeing to their FIRM LD obligation. The fax number to TJ's desk is 713.646.8272 If they disagree, make sure you get the information above to let the lawyers track the information flow.

Also, we need to keep track of hourly prices across the eastern inter-connect. This is coming directly from Kevin Presto. We are going to compile a database to use when handling FIRM LD Obligations and what the market prices were at that exact time. The prices are going to be vital in getting an accurate read of what to charge our customers. Be prepared to handle a call from a desk head (Kevin,Fletch,Dana) regarding any possible schedule curtailments and what prices are anywhere in the eastern inter-connect

Please work hard to fulfill these requirements. 


If you have any question, let Don or myself know

Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.  As speakers were 
confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the 
speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those 
speakers.  Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, 
drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.  We have 
arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy 
chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a 
means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.  This 
can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  

The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement 
of our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short 
"state of the union of operations" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and 
EEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, 
discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  

Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in 
which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of 
operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could 
have such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the 
afternoon.  

Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move 
Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and 
lessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going 
project.  

Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool 
for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  

We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its 
impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted 
Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  

Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles 
Center Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are 
waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  

Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.  
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal 
presentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will 
be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action 
steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information 
provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office 
services within Enron.  

Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.  
Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.  
After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to 
reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against 
our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  

Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.  The only details still 
in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's 
attendance.

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian

9/6 8:30pm vs. Raiders

Need your book list from amazon.com!!!!   May sleet and snow tonight but I
think the ground is too warm to  stick or get icy.  Although I could use a
day off work!  Send me your christmas list!  Also, I see that Enron and
Dynegy have been negotiating for days.....this concerns me.  they cannot
seem to come up with a new price.  Are you continuing to lose trading?
what % of normal trades are you now doing a day?  I just hope you and
Matthew are OK.  And Jeannie.  Let me know.  Love you, Mom.

Subject:	OneOk Talking Points

Below are the talking points that I'd propose we run by Stan and then have Stan use with John Gibson and Dave use with Terry Spencer.  Once everyone is OK with these, I'll email to Stan and Dave with a brief explanation that our recommendation is that we politely decline the suggestion from Steve Winston that we voluntarily rewrite the measurement agreement.  

1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That structure is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers from Northern's ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a "BTU measurement error".

2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOK's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications.  ONEOK's independent outside experts, Barnes and Click, confirmed this fact during the arbitration. 

3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine whether to call a "special test" of the accuracy of Northern's ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon calling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.

4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications.

5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, based on Northern's meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of Northern's meters, the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.

Sally - I asked Anne Koehler to give you a call - I think the non-solicit period is for one year.  The tricky bit is that we can't prevent our employees approaching AEP for  job ( or responding to AEP advertisements for a job).

Michelle,

Do you do employment agreements for EBS, if not, who is the attorney I should 
contact?  Bill is a Trading Manager for EBS and will be transferring to EGM 
in the near future.  Bill evidently had a draft of an employment agreement 
that was not executed.  Shankman and Nowlan want to offer him a contract and 
want to start with the same terms drafted by EBS.

Thanks,
Shanna

Subject: Canadian Outsourcing Deals

I met with Peggy Hedstrom and to some extent with Laura Scott  in Calgary 
regarding how they handle the day to day activity of their producer 
outsourcing deals.


The producer provides to EC their projected production schedule for the year 
by month by plant outlet. This information is entered into Sitara by EC on a 
single ticket with no meter information. For the prompt month EC confirms 
back to the producer their expected production volumes by point by day. This 
includes any maintenance or scheduled down time that would affect their daily 
flows. This information is contained within a Excel spreadsheet which can be 
viewed by the producer via a common network drive.

The producer communicates to EC their sales for the month and on a daily 
basis. EC enters these trades in Sitara. The Sitara position by producer is 
balanced to zero daily. The producer does not have access to Sitara.

EC acts as agent for the downstream transportation owned by producer. They 
have no diversion rights on this transport, it is utilised at the direction 
of the producer. EC nominates producers transport. All transport expense 
estimates are maintained by EC. EC is invoiced and pays the pipeline.

EC monitors estimated hourly flows from the plant outlets as provided by 
Nova. It is the responsibility of EC to inform the producer of significant 
variances in their scheduled versus estimated flows. Nova requires that 
shippers be balanced on a daily basis or face penalties if variances are out 
of tolerance. It is EC's responsibility to keep the producer out of penalty 
situations. The producer, at the direction of EC, either sells or buys on an 
intraday basis to balance their position on the pipeline. Final estimated 
flows are then downloaded by EC into the Excel spreadsheet. This final 
estimate is than used as the expected volume for the upcoming day.  And 
Sitara is updated accordingly.

At months end the spreadsheet information is transferred to an accounting 
system referred to as Solomon. Actual volumes as provided by the pipeline are 
also entered into the system for settlement. I didn't have a lot of time to 
devote to the accounting process, but I doubt ENA would take this approach.

EC utilises a single point of contact with each producer from a logistics and 
origination standpoint. Peggy said they did not hire people specifically from 
the producer/customers but did seek out people with extensive producer 
experience to assist with these customers. Peggy feels that their success is 
due in a large part to the very strong relationships they have developed with 
their customers through this point of contact approach.

It is of note that Unify is not utilised in managing these customers 
business. Peggy feels that Unify is not  designed to handle it and response 
time is too slow for their purposes given the time constraints they are 
working under on a daily basis.

This is an Editorial written by an American citizen, published in
a Tampa
Newspaper. He did quite a job.


 IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT I am tired of this nation
worrying
 about whether we are offending some individual or their culture.
Since
 the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have experienced a surge in
patriotism
 by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks
had barely
 settled when the "politically correct" crowd began complaining
about the
 possibility that our patriotism was offending others. I am not
against
 immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking
a
 better life by coming to America. Our population is almost
entirely comprised of
 descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things that
those who
 have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here,
need to
 understand. This idea of America being a multicultural community
has
 served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.
As Americans,
 we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and
our own
 lifestyle. This culture has been developed over centuries of
struggles,
 trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have
sought
 freedom.
 We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese,
Russian, or any
 other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our
society,
 learn the language! "In God We Trust" is our national motto. This
is not some
 Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto
because
 Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this
nation,
 and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to
display it on
 the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you
consider
 another part of the world as your new home, because God is part
of our
 culture. If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle
Sam,
 then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this
planet. We
 are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we
really don't
 care how you did things where you came from. This is OUR COUNTRY,
our
 land, and our lifestyle. Our First Amendment gives every citizen
the right to
 express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do
so.
 But, once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about
our flag, our
 pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly
encourage you to
 take advantage of one other great American freedom, THE RIGHT TO
LEAVE!

Please pass this along if you agree.

I'm hoping you've missed my pestering emails about the HR policy project.  Its time for an update and I think you'll enjoy knowing the project matures and the prospects are looking good.  The talent from the Associate & Analyst teams are making good progress on both the content and the delivery fronts.  I would like to share some of the near term mileposts with you and schedule a calibration meeting. 

1.	Plan to attend a N-Form group meeting the week of September 24.  The Content and Delivery teams will each be asked to provide a 30 min preview of their 	projects.  This will be an important calibration opportunity for their work and I'm hoping for a good turnout from the N-Form Group.  Jo Ann Matson will provide a 	outlook invitation later this week.
2.	The concept and opportunity are being engaged by highly motivated participants.  Content team plans to have a policy straw man, complete with N-form links 	and 	underlying resources, ready to pass to the delivery team by September 24.  Delivery team has scoped the live-link issues and they have engaged the right parties to 	define access and posting considerations.  The recently revised HR web page will be the net platform for content and the control and revision of content issues 	are being assessed.  As soon as the team has content to manipulate, I would expect they will begin testing.  Please be prepared to help this team scope the 	relevant considerations during their respective presentations.
3.	Content validation will be a N-Form Group responsibility the first two weeks of October 2001,    N-Form Group will need to validate and endorse the program in 	preparation for its recommendations and presentations to HR leadership.   
4.	Presentation to HR Leadership, - by agenda, mid October
5.	Marketing and PR Phase - 
6.	N-Form Policy launch, October 31, 2001.  ( due to regulatory notice requirements, some of the policy changes contemplated to be effective on Jan 1, 2002 must be 	communicated to employees by Nov. 1, 2001.

Please relay these program developments to leadership as appropriate. I hope you will look forward the next N-Form meeting .  IJo Ann will provide a call in number for those who cannot attend.  Regards, Rj.

Hi,
 I just came across following discussion on Economics that provides an interesting insight.

Economic philosophies explained in terms of two cows:
Socialism - You have two cows.  You give one to your neighbor.
Communism - You have two cows.  The government takes both and gives you milk.
Fascism - You have two cows.  The government takes them both and sells you the milk.
Capitalism - You have two cows.  You sell one and buy a bull.
Bureaucracy - You have two cows.  The government takes them both, shoots one,  milks the other, pays you for the milk , then pours it down the drain.
Corporate - You have two cows.  You downsize one, then require the other one to produce the milk of four cows, then act surprised when it falls dead.
Democracy - You have two cows.  You are taxed to the point where you have to sell them both so that the government can support a man in a foreign country who has one cow, which was a gift from your country.

Hope you enjoyed.

Inja Chun

Hi,
I'm working with Dave Forster to put together an Originator's Toolkit, that will contain a description of various products (many from Janelle's Product Descriptions) that the originators and mid marketers can offer customers.  Since many of the products are option based I'd like to run the toolkit by you all to look over.  I'd appreciate any comments.  Also if there are any additional products that I should add please let me know.
Thanks,
Max

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

To:	The Enron Management Committee


The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the "Policy") on August 14, 2001, and notice has been distributed to Enron employees to announce the posting of this policy on the Enron intranet website at http://home.enron.com/resources (without market risk limits due to confidentiality).  The Policy includes a three page Executive Summary providing an overview of risk management practices for the four major types of risks addressed: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk, and this summary is attached to this e-mail for your convenience.  The credit policy was incorporated without change, and the Transaction Approval Process and Guarantee Approval Processes were also incorporated with updating for specific approval authorities. 

This e-mail message is being sent to the Enron Management Committee to highlight some key aspects of the Company's market risk management practices which may be of interest.  

The Policy established a new Risk Management Committee, members of which are the Chief Risk Officer and any others designated by the CEO of Enron Corp.  During this transition period, existing Commodity Group Limits as of August 14th remain in effect, and Enron Business Unit Limits are assigned accordingly.  These limits may be further adjusted by the Risk Management Committee and the CEO, and your market risk managers will be working with you to review the limit structure for your business unit's activities to facilitate compliance with the Policy and your business initiatives.  RAC is currently working with Global Risk Management Operations to develop appropriate risk reporting that meets the Policy requirements and the needs of business unit management.

Cassandra Schultz

Summary of Changes to Market Risk Management Practices

In addition to consolidating Enron's various risk management policies and procedures into one comprehensive Policy, some substantive changes and clarifications were made to the Company's market risk management practices, as summarized below.  

1.	Increased the VaR Limit for the Trading Portfolio, providing discretion to the Enron Corp. CEO ("CEO") to allocate such VaR limits within defined parameters
2.	Established an Expected Tail Loss Advisory Limit for the Trading Portfolio
3.	Revised the Market Risk Limit Structure within each Portfolio to delegate more discretion for individual Business Unit and Commodity Group limits to the CEO and Risk Management Committee
a)   Concentration VaR Limits approved by Board of Directors 
b)   Business Unit VaR Limits approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
c)   Commodity Group Limits for each Business Unit approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
d)   Trader/Desk Limits approved by Business Unit Office of the Chairman


Key Points re: the Limit Structure
1.	Concentration Limits are established on 6 large buckets of commodity groups; this bucketing focuses on market indicators from a Board perspective, not according to Enron's organizational structure; 
?	1) Americas Gas, 2) Americas Power, 3) European Gas & Power, 
4) Products, 5) Financials, and 6) Emerging Businesses
o	Examples:  Americas Power Concentration Limit includes Global Risk Markets; Financials Concentration Limit includes Credit; Appendix A of the Policy lists the individual Commodity Groups comprising each Concentration Limit
2.	CEO/Risk Management Committee has discretion to allocate the Trading Portfolio VaR limit among the Enron Business Units, subject to the Concentration Limits approved by the Board
3.	Expected Tail Loss is a new risk metric, and accordingly, an advisory limit is established only at the total Trading Portfolio level; some Commodity Groups may have the measurement calculated in RisktRAC, but no limit is set
4.	Business Unit VaR Limits are to be set for each Enron Business Unit (i.e. Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Europe, etc. - any Business Units recognized as having authority for trading by the CEO)
5.	Commodity Group Limits are now to be set at a Business Unit level, representing the individual Business Unit's authority for trading specific commodities
?	every Business Unit shall have a Commodity Group Limit for any commodities for which they are authorized to trade; 
?	these Commodity Group Limits and corresponding risk reporting will enable top management and the Risk Management Committee to quickly understand risk parameters on a "pure" commodity group basis within each Enron Business Unit;
6.	Each Enron Business Unit OOC can establish Trader/Desk Level Limits and/or related risk reporting as they require, enabling them to view their trading results the way they manage their business (i.e., the same trader may actually trade more than one commodity, and therefore wish to view risk parameters for several commodities combined, etc.)

Risk Management Benefits of Limit Structure: 1) CEO flexibility below the Concentration Limit level, and 2) individual Enron Business Units have clearly defined trading authority, enabling the Risk Management Committee to authorize business units to trade in the same commodities while strengthening risk management practices to facilitate compliance with the Board approved Concentration Limits 

Limit Monitoring and Reporting
1.	All position and VaR violations are triggered at 100% of the respective limit
2.	All Daily Loss notifications are triggered at 100% of the VaR limit
3.	All Cumulative 5-day Loss notifications are triggered at 225% of the VaR limit 
4.	Trading Portfolio limit monitoring reported to the Board
5.	Concentration limit monitoring reported up to the CEO, and at Board meetings
6.	Business Unit and Commodity Group limit monitoring reported up to the Risk Management Committee
7.	Trader/Desk Level Limits and related reporting to be established by each business unit

Overall Portfolio Structure
?	Expanded the Trading Portfolio includes all of Enron's mark-to-market trading activity, including speculative trading of PGE and ETS 
?	Merchant Portfolio does not have established limits
?	Clarified that the Capital Portfolio is to capture and manage all positions related to Enron's capital structure; the VaR limit established is a Concentration Limit for Enron stock related transactions; as other positions are captured and measured, additional limits may be established as needed
Added a new "Regulated" Portfolio for certain transportation and distribution activities (a VaR limit was established by the Board for PGE's regulated activities)
?	Added a new "Other Assets & Contracts" Portfolio to capture and manage accrual or other type of positions not otherwise captured in the other Portfolios; no limits established

Hi.  To complete our discussion on the  manual monitoring & also to clarify, 
see below.

Greg Whiting will call ENA whenever he enters more than a specified number of 
changes in the SAP T880 table. He will transition this procedure to the SAP 
COE.  What is the threshold that Global needs to be notified?  Who in Global 
should be notified?

To clarify, the verification is manual & is subject to human error, such as 
someone forgets or is on vacation.  If a large file is sent without 
notification during the day, the impact is significant.  I think moving the 
job to run in the evening will virtually eliminate the potential for this 
problem to occur again.  However, to eliminate the risk completely I suggest 
that the verification be automated.  You said that you'll have the ability to 
do this in global in a few months.  If you can't do it, then we (SAP) need to 
write an automated monitoring program.

Subject: SAP / Global/ Unify replication problem on Friday June 30th


On Friday June 30th, Unify's production performance was impacted by a large 
volume (30k) of replication/ configuration transactions from SAP.
The mass update from SAP to Global/ Unify effected Enron's business 
throughout the afternoon, causing contract replication to be delayed, and 
missed nominations.

Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur again:
Global Replication - Move the SAP to Global/ Unify replication for 
Intercompany from hourly to a nightly (1:00 am) process.  As we could miss 
new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced.
SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled 
'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak 
time.

Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

For those that are interested, although no scheduling order has been
issued yet by Judge Young in the Northeast RTO case, a quick glance at
FERC's Hearing Room reservation page
(http://www.ferc.gov/public/isd/daysched.htm) indicates that Hearing
Rooms 1 and 2 are reserved by Judge Young for Northeast RTO Mediations
on July 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and 31.

Of course the fact that the rooms are reserved does not necessarily mean
that meetings will be held on all of those days. Nevertheless, parties
might be well advised to pack for more than just one overnight next
week, just in case....

Also, as a number of folks have expressed interest in the same question,
I provide the following. On behalf of the Price Responsive Load
Coalition, I have asked Judge Young to provide guidance on whether new
parties will be admitted to the mediation and, if so, whether they can
request party status at the meeting on the 24th. I will share whatever
guidance I receive with this list.

Hello, everyone.  Please let me know which of these dates works best for 
you.  It would be most helpful if you give me a range of available dates for 
both preparation and the deposition itself.  That way, I can find overlapping 
dates on which you all are available.  

Thanks a lot.

Michelle

I have really spent alot of time reviewing the situation this weekend.  I
hope you have accepted my apologies and understood my thoughts about what
happened.  As I said, I put myself in your shoes and can understand what you
view is on many of the points.  I hope you could understand some of my
confusion on how the dinner went.

I do not think it will be easy for either group to put it behind us.  I hope
you understand that you are an important customer for us (which is why the
entire gulf desk went to dinner with you) and earning and keeping your
respect is important.  We have a long way to go in that area.

I hope things will be better today.  I am not going to have the Gulf desk
turn on the box until I hear from you.  I apologize that I did not catch the
"box time" on Thursday due to the scattered  schedules the Gulf desk was
keeping along with myself (long conference call); otherwise, you would have
had a call from me when things settled down that day.

Sincerely,

Steve

Garcia Throws, but Still Questionable

BY DENNIS GEORGATOS
Mercury News

Quarterback Jeff Garcia tested his sore ribs Thursday, briefly running plays
and passing during the 49ers' team drills on a rain-soaked practice field.

Backup Tim Rattay still handled the bulk of the practice snaps and Garcia
remains questionable for Saturday's game at 3Com Park against the
Philadelphia Eagles.

Coach Steve Mariucci said he was encouraged by Garcia's outing but the
quarterback's playing status could be a game-time decision.

``I didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing,'' Mariucci said.
``I saw him throw a couple of frozen ropes in there. We didn't overdo it
with him. We'll see. I don't know what to predict but he's making some
progress. The important thing will be how it feels'' today.

Garcia, who has started the past 34 games for the 49ers, tore rib-cage
cartilage when he was tackled Sunday during a 21-0 victory over the Miami
Dolphins.

``I felt pretty good in throwing the ball in our 7-on-7 period,'' Garcia
said. ``I didn't want to make it any worse. But I was able to practice and
felt good about that. I felt crisp and I felt sharp. And it made me more
confident as far as going into Saturday.''

If Garcia is unable to play, Rattay would make his first NFL start. Rattay
has thrown one pass in his two-year NFL career.

If Rattay does start because of Garcia's injury, Rick Mirer could be his
backup. Garcia still could be available in an emergency as the third
quarterback.

************* Our View **************

Another sketchy call here.  It's encouraging news but still a game time
decision.   It's pretty much the same advice as with Steve McNair:  If you
have a good backup, I'd go there.   Garcia could play, but there is
definitely the chance he sits and you probably can't risk a zero from your
QB.

More if we hear it.   Thanks to Footballguy Bob Albright, Jr for pointing me
to this one.

Joe

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

If only 150 MW can be called on when the NYISO needs them then no more than
150 MW should be allowed to qualify as ICAP providers.  The purpose of ICAP
is to assure that the NYISO has capacity when it needs it.  "Having" the
capacity and then not being allowed to use it makes the capacity worthless.
Resources that cannot be called upon are do not add to system security.

Subject:        RE: 150 mW DEC Cap for "Emergency Exempt" for EDRP

Larry:

A couple of comments:

1. I recommend that the 150 MW limit be managed by NYISO Operations.  They
are going to understand the problems in real time and should have complete
authority of which generators get run based on the situation. Trying to
fairly rotate which units get called at this late date, given the hours of
operation are completely unknown would be a waste of time, in my opinion.

2. We all should be very grateful that the DEC has taken the action they
have on expanding the exempt generator definition.  If people are not happy
with the 150MW cap then they should get a registration or state facility
permit and notify the ISO that the their site is not to be counted in the
150 MW cap calculation.

3. Not paying full ICAP for these resources would be a disaster.  If we want
to kill the emergency program, this is the best way to do it.  Again,
calling of generators should be based on the NYISO Operations assessment of
the emergency situation.  A special case resource generator standing ready
to serve, even if DEC has placed some limits on the number of MW running at
one time, should not be penalized by this cap.  We may find situations where
some of the SCR "exempt" generators called can not start or limit their
generation hours for some reason.  In this case we need as many SCR
resources ready to fill the void as possible. Limit payments really hurts
the credibility and effectiveness of the programs we have all worked so hard
to develop.

4. I do not think the EDRP manuals need to say anything on this subject.
This should strictly be an internal NYISO operation matter on which
generators get called in each zone.  If the Operations manual needs to be
updated to reflect the 150 MW exempt generator class of EDRP generators lets
do it here not in the EDRP manual.

Looking forward to Monday's discussion. Have a great weekend.

Subject:        150 mW DEC Cap for "Emergency Exempt" for EDRP

Colleagues,
This is a "heads up" that there are several issues we will need to look at
on Monday with respect to the new NYS DEC expanded definition of "emergency
exempt" when participating in the EDRP.  The problems needing solving that I
am aware of so far concern the 150 mW cap that DEC placed on the ISO's call
for emergency customer generation.  Our understanding is that more than that
amount can be signed up for the program--but only 150 mWs can be called at
any one time.

Some have suggested that the DEC does not have the right or power to
regulate the NYISO.  I don't know.  But I do know that DEC would revoke this
in heart-beat if they thought we were going to ignore it--especially after
all these different parties, including the ISO and the self-generation
developers, bargained with NYS DEC to do what they have done.  Also, the
individual participating customers would be more than some upset if they
found out that DEC was revoking their emergency exempt status because they
were deemed to have been the ones who were over the 150 mW limit in an
emergency call.

There are two problems that I have seen, both related to enrolling more than
150 mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants.  First, if there is more than
150 mWs in the region being called, we need to determine a method for who
gets called--it could rotate in an equitable fashion.  But our manual should
probably speak to this.

The other problem is that we probably shouldn't be paying full ICAP to 300
mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants if we know that no more than half
of them can respond to any ICAP call.  We might derate them in percentage to
the subscription over the 150 mWs.  Or some other system.

My purpose here is to alert you to the issue and suggest that we want to
come up with a solution on Monday.  I spoke with Mollie Lampi about it and
hope the ISO has a chance to work on it today.  We want all EDRP and DADRP
manual matters to go before the BIC on May 24th.

Have a great weekend and thanks for all of the creative thinking and
constructive participation on getting these programs as right as we can as
quickly as we can!

Larry

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know that North America included US drift in its plan and includes "drift earnings" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and I will do what ever you guys decide.

Gary

I prepare the London Summary and I have been requested by John Sherriff here in London to have changes made to the reporting format of the Executive Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed below.  In essence, John would like Enron Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be reported under the 'Enron Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate changes.  If, however,  you would like to discuss the matter further please contact John Sherriff.

Changes are required to the reporting format of Enron Europe's P/L in the Executive Viewer .  Below is a list of these changes as well as the person responsible for effecting each change:

Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'Enron Global Markets' heading to the 'Enron Europe' heading; 

Susie Ayala: The Enron Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'Enron Europe' heading;

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under the 'Enron Europe' heading:
	- J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
	- Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
	- For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).

11:22 02Aug2001 RSF-Ill. Quad Cities 2 nuke shut after lightning strike

    NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Exelon Nuclear said Thursday a lightning strike at the Quad Cities plant in Cordova, Ill. caused a fire in unit 2's main transformer that caused the 789-megawatt (MW) unit to shut down.
    Exelon said in a statement that the fire was quickly extinguished at 8:45 a.m. Central Time by the site's fire brigade and the Cordova Fire Department. The lightning strike occurred at about 8:15 a.m.
    With the loss of the off-site power during the event, Exelon declared an "Unusual Event" at 8:23 a.m. An Unusual Event is the lowest of four emergency classifications used by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to categorize events at commercial nuclear power plants.
    Exelon said there were no injuries and no potential for a radioactivity release as a result of the fire. The main transformer is located outside the plant.
    Exelon said the adjacent 789-MW unit 1 continues to operate at a slightly reduced power level.

Hi Eric,
 
I am excited that you will get back to work now.  I know you don't like being bored.
 
Sorry about Tahoe.  Las Vegas sounds interesting.  I'll talk to Dad.  I talked with Vivian this morning and we are planning on a golf trip maybe to Mexico.  I don't know when we will be going.  Las Vegas is not my first choice for a vacation after such a long time without one.  However, I welcome any opportunity to spend time with our son.  I'll talk with him tonight and let you know.
 
Have a great weekend.  Hi to Shanna.

Thanks.  Of the two - I think UBS is better.  It seems like they are a smaller, more specialized company that is more similar to our culture from a risk tolerance perspective.  It should be good.  Of course, anything is better than the way it has been.
 
We are not going to be able to go to Tahoe anymore b/c of scheduling conflicts with my boss, so we are planning on going to Las Vegas from Feb 13-16.  The airfare is $200/person roundtrip and we can stay at the aladdin or rio for about $100/night (or the bellagio for $200/night). We were wondering if you guys would be interested in joining us?
 
Let me know.

We have surpassed the Enron 2001 minimum commitment spend of $8,000,000 with EDS.  We would not have met our commitment without being creative and asking EDS to purchase $5,000,000 worth of flat screens for use in Enron Center South.  In 2002 we once again have an $8,000,000 "take or pay" commitment.  Currently, we have approximately $3,000,000 worth of 2002 EDS utilization commitments from various Enron business units.  Which means we will need another $5,000,000 worth of creative EDS spend in 2002.  

After 2002 the Enron spend commitment to EDS is $5,000,000 per year with no set contract termination.  My understanding is that the way in which the original financing deal with EDS was booked deters us from ending our relationship with EDS.   

Please find the details attached.

Tim,

(1) We rescinded approximately 8 offers in November. It was decided that individuals who gave up jobs to accept our offer would be paid out one month of salary (with a signed release). I had two people who fell into this category and signed releases but have not received the one month salary. Will they be paid out?

(2) I have received several calls from terminated employees concerning the termination letters. They are concerned that they have 30 days in which to transfer to their spouse's plan and won't meet the deadline. My understanding is that the terminations letter will be mailed out soon. Please advise?

Regards
Frank

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Dear John

In place of the original transfer of options that we sent you yesterday, I
propose the following transfer instead. You will note that it includes no
options at all.

short 1660 May 2002 futures

Please understand that this entire affair is making me as uncomfortable as
it is clearly making you.

Kind regards
Kevin R Davis

Mr. Fleming:

Thanks so much for the helpful letter on membership and general information. Your letter indicated that I should make application through the Membership Committee, who would provide me with an application. You copied Cmde. Roth on the letter so I will contact him to request an application or schedule a meeting. (I have no contact information for him other than through the PYC, is that appropriate?) 

I found a potential slip at Great Cove Boat Club and was wondering if you had heard of this marina and if other members used this facility.

Thanks again for getting back to me.

Richard (Rick) Buy

P.S. I heard on the news one of the pilots was from Portsmouth. So tragic. I'm sure people there are as devastated as they are here.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

Things to Remember:
We cannot see the future. We cannot change the past.
We can only live in the now with an eye towards
gaining enough power in the future to wreak revenge on
everyone who ever screwed us in the past.

Dreaming frees the soul, energizes the spirit and
allows you to do things that would get your ass thrown
in jail if you really tried them.

Love means never having to say, "Does that twenty
include the spanking?

To truly love another, you must first love yourself.
And it wouldn't kill you to wash your hands in between
either.

A little bit of love goes a long way in our lives. It
can provide us with higher highs and lower lows. But,
if it comes with a persistent burning sensation, see
your physician.

When it becomes a crime to love, you should probably
consider dating outside the family.

If Life hands you lemons today, smile and give thanks.
Then when Life isn't looking, give him a quick knee to
the groin. That'll learn him.

They say a smile is a gift which is free to the giver
and precious to the recipient. But giving the finger
is free, too, and I find it more personal and sincere.

	I talked with Mary Darveaux and there are some possible billing changes  coming that
	we need to discuss in the morning.

	1.  There may be a 10 day lag on pricing
	2.  The MPS imbalance volume will be taken out of the tiering denominator
		calculation. (as well as fuel)
	3.  We need to run a report to see how oftern (if at all) we have had imbalances on MPS contracts.

	Do you have any time Wed. morning?  What about 9:00 a.m. in my office?  If that
	doesn't work we can look at tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks. Lynn

Looks like we are on track to resolve all outstanding requirements except the prior month imbalance.  The data we need is not currently available by point, only contract.  Perhaps a meeting with IT Accounting Support would be the best next step.  Also, it would be nice to turn over the code we have to someone in IT for long-term implementation.  Lynn what are your thoughts?

Dear Shona,

Actually, I am waiting on the deal test samples from Leslie (if this is still 
the game plan) before giving Jennifer the total package, which Jennifer 
understands.  She followed up with a call requesting a summary of findings in 
lieu of the working papers, at least for now.  She is calling me everyday, 
and I think it would be good to bring closure to this.  I have not heard 
anything from Leslie.  If you and Leslie are happy with the remainder of the 
deal test, I will x-ref the working papers as such, and we can ship the 
papers on to Jennifer.

Thanks, Shona!
Ken

Dear Ken,

She is actually asking for the deal test samples etc.  You need to give her 
this (I don't have any of it).

Thanks

Hi Shona,

Jennifer Stevenson (AA) left a voice mail in which she indicated that she was 
looking for a summary/recap of the Portland review.  Once the Portland report 
is finalized, would you forward her the information she requires?

Thank you,
Ken

The answer to your question is that all emissions reported on the emissions 
inventory should be included in the calculation of emissions fees. This leads 
to another question-what emissions should be reported on the emissions 
inventory?

I discussed this issue with a TNRCC emissions inventory team leader. He 
informed me that that is no written guidance on how to report upset, 
maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions on the emissions inventory, and 
as a result be included in emission fees. He did indicate that at previous 
emissions inventory workshops, attendees were verbally told to only include 
"reportable" (emissions that exceed RQ) on their inventories, and not  
"recordable" (non-reportable) emissions. He also mentioned that one ton/year 
would also be an acceptable threshold for including emissions in the 
inventory.

He is aware that  upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions are an 
important issue, now that they are included in fees. He indicated that TNRCC 
will be putting out definitive information on this issue in future emissions 
inventory workshops and guidance, in preparation for submittal of calendar 
year 2001 inventories that will be due in 2002.

Subject: TNRCC Emission Fees

In the last session, legislation was passed in Texas that requires the 
payment of emission fees for upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown 
emissions. Previously these emissions were required to be included in 
emission inventories, but not when calculating the fees. Funds generated by 
the inclusion of these emissions are to be used by TNRCC for enforcement and 
monitoring activities for air quality permitting, air quality assessment and 
planning, and enforcement and compliance support. 
TNRCC is requiring that the additional fees for upset, maintenance, start-up, 
and shutdown emissions be included in the fees that are due this Fall for 
calendar year 2000 emissions. Industry groups are questioning the legality of 
TNRCC requiring the added fees for 2000 emissions since the effective date of 
the legislation was September, 2001. TNRCC is being requested to change this 
and legal action is being considered. I will keep you updated as this issue 
develops.

Just a couple of things, since we will not be able to meet this week.

The auditors have started review no. 2 of the management report.  I imagine 
it will take them at least a couple of weeks  per Louise's request, the 
auditors are re-reviewing the management report to ensure that all the 
changes were made and the report is now accurate
I think you are aware of all the new products Dale is working on (!!!) we 
have several things in the works right now, the primary ones being a park and 
loan agreement that will be managed out of Chicago, and reliable power
Lots and lots of ad hoc reporting (see my earlier e-mail regarding timing of 
these reports - we need a decision quickly - this is taking up most of Matt's 
time, and with the additional reports requested, it will take up the rest of 
it)  I have been sending you the weekly reports we are doing to John and 
Jeff.  Louise asked that we provide similar reports for Europe.  We are 
starting this week on these
We really need to push the profiles manager application - we are getting 
swamped with all the new customers and products (Frank was to talk to Mark D. 
on Friday - I should have an update from him today)  this new application 
will save a ton of manual work - this is something we started as soon as I 
took over the group, and also was one of the auditors comments.  Currently, 
we are manually entering profiles directly into EOL.  This application we 
requested will allow each of the depts (Credit, Global and Legal) to enter 
their own profiles into EOL, and we will just become the reviewer of the data 
via daily reporting.  The application has been tested, but due to the fact 
that the IT group is so busy, we have been placed on the back-burner.  I am 
going to turn up the heat on this b/c we are getting overloaded.
New reporting application - we are in the process of testing now.   It will 
probably be at least a month before it is completed.  This is our new Oracle 
application that will replace the Access report Euginio built
Torrey will be attending the 8am meeting for me in the morning and will send 
me notes  this is the weekly marketing/phase 2 meeting
I am currently reviewing the latest version of the price posting agreement to 
determine what our roles will be once we are posting prices on the other 
platforms (looks like most of it will fall in Dale's world)  You probably saw 
the announcement that we are going to post prices on other websites 
(HoustonStreet and True Quote) that was made on Thursday last week.  
Basically, we have 90 days to make this happen.  IT will build the link to 
these other sites, and we will need to ensure that price are reflected 
properly and that product long and short descriptions are accurate.  I have 
read about 25% of the agreement thus far and am developing a list of 
questions and concerns surrounding this.
We still are not including the proper weather valuation in the management 
report - the numbers are not going to be significant, but we need to report 
this appropriately asap.  Any decision here?  We have been working with the 
weather risk groups to determine how to appropriately value the weather 
transactions.  About a month ago, we reached an agreement with them and have 
been waiting on Dave's approval to change the valuation ever since.  
Keith has made some suggestions on how we can improve the Remedy application 
- I am reviewing while I am here  This is the application that the call 
center uses to track issues
I will send you the suggestions Stephanie has for improving the new security 
application - she will document these for me today  A new SRRS system is in 
place via the Intranet. 

stuff for you -
Carrie S. will begin her 6 month assignment now.  She will be in Australia 
for 3 weeks to assist Justin (the PCG person in the Pacific), then to London 
for a month to work with Amita, and the duration will be spent working with 
the London EOL Marketing team
Justin just completed 3 weeks of training on EOL and EOL applications.  I 
think he will do an excellent job - I was very impressed with his questions 
and how quickly he picked things up.


Just send me any questions you have -

Thanks
Sheri

Today FERC issued the following draft orders:

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made "but for" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

Based on my discussions with Sally, and her discussions with Ted and Rick 
Carson, I've updated the process flows for Doorstep teams.  I've defined the 
roles and responsibilities for each group as well, which were not included in 
the original draft.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Heidi:

Please outline the Vulcan contract for Jeff and Jennifer.  They also have 
development questions as to their market capability of metals.  Please call 
Lenard at Vulcan and see what is the type, grade and volumes they purchase.  
We may be able to provide additional leverage to their purchases.

Thanks,

Craig

Jeff,
Please investigate this company and see if there  are additional Enron 
products and services like metals that might be of interest.  They are a 
pretty small gas user but there might be greater prospects in other areas.  
What is the value of the contract that we have entered with them?

 <A HREF="http://www.radio-stations.net/index.php3">Click here: Radio
stations from around the world</A>

This is a good site to quickly find worldwide radio stations on the
internet....can sort any way first by continent then by news, talk, type of
music etc.   Can be very interesting to "tune in" to say a world hot spot
when something is happening.  I go to KOMA and Bob Brinker and Guam from
here.   For instance, there was some news on a possible military takeover on
the island of Fiji this morning...i went to a Fiji news station.

Alison,
The employment agreements for the Japan employees state in the vesting schedule [for the stock options granted as a signing bonus]:
vesting for the options will be as follows:
-One third on the first anniversary of date of employment
-A further third on the second anniversary date of employment
-The final third on the third anniversary date of employment

The options can not vest on the anniversary of the date of employment, rather it is supposed to vest on the anniversary of date of grant.
Michelle,
Correct me if I am wrong--we can still go ahead and grant these for the November 1 grant date, but we need to get an amendment to change that wording.
Thank you
Dana Bryant

Hi John !

My mistake again early morning...  I clicked on Gas Daily Henry Hub (EOL
#1107435,    I buy 5,000 MMBtu/day  May @ 5.51)  instead of NYMEX.

Could you change it to NYMEX ?

Thank you and sorry again,

Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.  I have to leave for the airport 
after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much 
easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  

Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it 
from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another 
thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to 
an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of 
tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to 
see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could 
discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  

I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large 
number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied 
up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls 
who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  

Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little 
travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is 
that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime 
tempurature reading!).

I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with 
David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that 
is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally

Sally:? I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not 
find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked 
notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both 
volunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call 
into Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I 
thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause 
Theatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did 
not complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can 
check with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will 
let you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your 
house, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is 
right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls 
call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is 
to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can 
hear your car...pretty basic.?
Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that 
meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let 
you know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with 
you.? This is the meeting I thought we might  dd Dad/ dtr but too close, so 
we better come up with another idea....dance  lesson, maybe...think Megan 
suggested that.? 
?
Have a good trip. Linda

Please see attached updated turbine report.  The previous report incorrected overstated the contract cost of the Arcos turbines.  Please note that only one Arcos turbine is shipboard and that the remaining two are still in fabrication.

Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of 
touch for the last week.  I read John's message to you and agree with him 
that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public 
support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and 
bite us.  As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is 
much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there 
does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to 
keep development to a minimum.  I will forward to you a memo from David 
Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing 
the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area.  
Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau 
of Land Management, State of Arizona,  State Historic Preservation Office and 
the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and 
Phoenix.  I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you 
know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there  appears to 
be trouble on the horizon.   John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this 
project and we would  like to take a more proactive approach  "up front" with 
regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground.  Its hard 
to deal with public issues when construction is underway. 

As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming 
that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will 
require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction 
activities to the existing right of way.  Proceeding south from Flagstaff to 
Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.  Once the 
pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be completed 
for the following:   threatened and endangered plants and animals, archeology 
surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should this portion 
of the project require installation of horsepower.  The FERC will require an 
EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report to be 
conducted.  These activities include not only the environemntal issues but 
also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past 
consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this 
greatly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to 
the rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix 
makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for 
the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire 
proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need to be 
walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we can 
identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the 
surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure.   
However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I 
would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline 
environmental work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys 
identify something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it 
is a WAG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at 
this time.  Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly 
assist in the environmental budgeting for this project.

Subject: Project Sun Devil EIS

I received the vmail from Bill last week basically stating there were no 
environmental deal killers for this new gas pipeline project, at least not 
from a 30,000 foot high level survey.  

My question is now what are our next steps?  I am building a work order 
authorization for some minimal dollars to get things like the ROW, EIS, etc. 
scoped out.  Assuming we have necessary market support, what would it cost to 
move to the next level on the EIS?  What do we get for our money?  I am 
mostly concerned about the "greenfield" portion of the line that would run 
from Flagstaff to Phoenix.  

Please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss an action plan.

thanks

I ran across this article in the Yomiuri Newspaper (but I cannot find it in 
the US press) and thought you might find it interesting in light of our 
inroads into Japan.

The presidents of Tokyo Power and Chubu Power announced that in the spring, 
they and eight other Japanese power companies would merge their 
telecommunications and Internet businesses into a new company.  This company 
seems to be based on a telecommunications joint venture (PNJ Communications) 
that they formed last year.  They are hoping to get 20% of their capital from 
the American company Qwest Communications International.

It is not strange to see Japanese companies cooperating with competitors.  
Joint ventures with Western companies are still rare, but less so recently, 
given the longevity of the economic malaise in Japan, and the severe 
profitability and balance sheet problems of some Japanese companies.  
Nevertheless, as far as I know, this is the first time that power companies 
have made such an effort.  In the past, they have generally maintained 
mutually respectful local monopolies.  I think that deregulation has them 
very worried.  I imagine that they will continue with this cooperation as 
they feel more and more threatened by Enron and other Western companies.

Here's a revised version of the severence/policy memo.  Michele, should we discuss how to address the severence plan in an email?  I included an alternative here to direct people to a website with the plan.

Thanks,

Friday June 29, 2001
The following  letter was sent today to the Midwest ISO Transmission Owners:
 
As we  move into the Market Trials period, I would like to reiterate how much the  Midwest ISO appreciates your support of our ongoing activities. 
To facilitate your participation in Market  Trials, we are providing two types of informative, interactive orientation  sessions.  One covers the  Electronic Scheduling Process and the other provides an overall Market  Trials Orientation.  These  sessions are designed to provide an essential overview of the drills, scenarios  and reviews necessary for your people to actively participate in the Market  Trials.
The Electronic Scheduling Process  session is available on three different dates in July and the overall Market  Trials Orientation session is offered on two different dates.  Because of the interactive nature of  these sessions the class size must be limited. Ideally, we would prefer no more  than two participants from each company. Please select the individual(s) from  your company who will attend these sessions, and forward the attached  registration brochure to them.   Please advise me if your needs exceed the requested attendance guideline  of two people per company. We will make every effort to accommodate your  request.
We recognize that asking you to sustain a  steady commitment of time, resources and manpower is an exacting demand.  Your confidence that your Market Trials  participants gain as much knowledge about the Midwest ISO's operational  abilities is equally important to us.
We are grateful for your continued support  of the Midwest ISO and look forward to working with you during the Market Trials  period. 
 
Sincerely,

I understand Diomedes owes Enron around $400,000 in expenses, that we may owe him money under the old ECI agreements and that he has not signed his severance agreement.  I think John and Michelle should discuss the matter and get back to the group with a plan.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

 

Jeffrey McMahon and Ray Bowen

Sally and Greg - if you are available, will you please plan to attend this meeting as observers also?  I will be sending another e-mail with more details.  Jeff McMahon suggested to Ken Lay that it would be good for you both to attend to be able to be updated on all that's going on.

Thanks.

FYI...according to Jeff, by the end of today the only position that will 
require manual adjustment is an IM Canada position (60 K's) that will be 
fixed next Monday when Kam Keiser goes back to Calgary.  Everything else is 
now automatically feeding to the GRMS system (and VAR calculations) without 
human intervention.

Steve - Mike asked  me to send him a list of what we had done to improve the 
top-level adjustments on the Benchmark.  Here are the things which we 
discussed earlier.

Mike - Let me know if you need anything else.

We have lowered the number of top-level adjustments substantially this week.  
We have taken several steps in order to achieve this.

1.  We had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into GRMS.  
2.  We are using a flip-out book for all Canadian deals done with the U.S. 
office so that Canadian positions are pulling in correctly.
3.  We had to adjust many book names in order that GRMS would pull the books 
into the system.  
4.  We had to change region codes in the system so that GRMS would pull in 
more than one book per region.

Issues remaining:

Intra-Month Canada
Chicago
Storage and Intra-East

Intra-month Canada - We have a risk person from the U.S. office going to 
Canada on Monday to fix their problems.
Chicago -  will be fixed by the end of the day.  System is looking for the 
wrong portfolio code.
Storage and Intra-East - Also will be fixed by the end of the day.  Overide 
books need to be set up.

Thanks

Eric,

Good to hear from you.  Hope you had a good Christmas and New Year's vacation.  I just got back to Boston last night.  I was in KY until the 30th then went skiing in Colorado (Copper and Winter Park) with some friends from here.  The snow wasn't great at Copper, but Winter Park was great and snowed the entire time we were there.  It's nice to be back at school, but I'm not looking forward to studying again.  Crossword puzzles and mutual fund research sound glorious right now.  Finals weren't too bad at all.  Normal classes are pretty intense, so there isn't much you can do in the way of preparation except relax and get plenty of sleep.  

Glad to hear that you still have a job.  I've been keeping up with Enron in the papers.  What's the latest on the trading division sale?  I knew that Citigroup had made a bid, but is anyone else expected to come in?  Summer internship interviews are coming up, so I'm sure I'll have plenty to talk about with Enron on my resume.  How are all of our friends making out?  I got an email from Plauche that he had been laid off.  What about Lenhart, Boucher, Chad, and everyone else?  

My dentist is Brian Kilgore, whom I liked very much.  He's out on I-10 and the Beltway.  He referred me to Thomas Weiler for the wisdom teeth surgery.  I think he's covered under the Enron dental plan, too.  

Enjoy the downtime while you have it.  Say hello to your family for me.  


Brian

The change has been implemented to drop the CURRENT day from the extract process. In this case, today is the 19th and there are NO daily records for the 19th in the file. Processing has just completed and this has been verified. Earlier today I contacted the oncall person for each company and let them know that the change had been implemeted and that no impact was expected to their processing. But, just in case, if there was a problem it may be associated with this change. I have no doubt that if there is a problem, everyone has my number. It's like an old worn out shoe.

I have an initial estimate of about 8 hours of work on the PGAS side.  I have asked Jeff to let me know when they plan to do the work and will let you know.

A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation Summary.
 
Issue:
 
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag for the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process current gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the incomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacting the imbalance calculation.
 
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current day volumes 
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
 
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will modify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes included in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
 
Blank     = Complete record
I             = Incomplete record
*             = Complete but edited record
 
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

Thank you

don't prove that "Enron has created the First Internet Global Commodities

Subject: Houston Gas & Power Controls/Standards Assessment

As you all are aware, there is a heightened awareness throughout the company 
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing 
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success 
at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on 
meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in 
an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their 
gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review 
to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement 
methodology for the London office.

In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards 
across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment 
for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and 
other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and 
Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.

I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so 
that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those 
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not 
operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to 
develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:
 - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash 
collections are timely)
 - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its 
maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date 
with            exceptions noted)
 - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard 
(i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)
 - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each 
measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)

I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control 
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of 
work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time 
requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to 
be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a 
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but 
it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.

As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for 
each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk 
associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and 
power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know 
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward 
to seeing you next week.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for 
Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start. His thumb is 
still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep 
him from playing. Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' 
passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting 
someone else this week.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big 
toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated. 
Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and 
expects he will be able to. Considering George has held up this well through 
a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he 
won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy 
numbers.  

 Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game 
against Oakland. With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and 
be the focus of the passing game. He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, 
though.  

 Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 The Steelers will be without Burress likely for the remainder of the season 
after learning he has a torn ligament and two broken bones in his right 
wrist. He said he originally sustained the injury during the season opener, 
but played the next 11 games despite constant pain in the wrist. Burress had 
it X-rayed and placed in a cast after practice yesterday, and it will require 
surgery. With him out, Courtney Hawkins will continue to start in his place 
for the next four games.  

 Jamel White , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Browns have listed White as questionable with a shoulder injury for 
Sunday's game against Jacksonville. He has performed fairly well spelling 
fellow rookie Travis Prentice in recent weeks, and may earn himself 
consideration in the Browns' RB plans for 2001. He won't provide you with 
much this season, though.  

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/30/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson, who has a knee 
injury, and Erik Storz, who has a broken thumb, as well as safety Erik Olson, 
who has an ankle injury, for Sunday's game against the Browns. Fortunately, 
linebackers Lonnie Marts, listed as probable after missing four games with a 
groin injury, and Kevin Hardy, probable with an ankle injury, are both 
expected to play. Despite all the injuries, keep in mind that this might be 
the best week to start the Jacksonville defense, as it faces a Cleveland 
offense that has been decimated by injuries.   

 Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 "The Green Lantern" had his light burned out last week against the Bears, 
catching only one pass for eight yards in the entire game. After four solid 
weeks, Chrebet has caught only four passes for 41 yards over his last two 
games. He faces off against a Colts' secondary that he burned for eight 
catches and 140 yards receiving in Week Ten, so a productive day is certainly 
not out of the question. Although he hasn't been overly consistent, Chrebet 
will likely find his way onto many starting lineups as the playoffs begin.    

 Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Shea is listed as questionable with a thigh muscle injury for Sunday's game 
in Jacksonville. If he can't play, either Mark Campbell, who served as the 
starter last Sunday, or O.J. Santiago would be the tight end. Even if he's 
healthy, Shea isn't going to carry your Fantasy team through the playoffs.  

 Richie Anderson , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Anderson continued to be the Jets' secret weapon last week, catching six 
passes for 69 yards and a score against the Bears. Although Anderson's 
numbers have been commendable between the lines, his value in the world of 
Fantasy isn't as solid. Unless you are involved in a deeper league, avoid 
playing Anderson during your Fantasy playoffs.      

 O.J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Santiago is listed as questionable with a knee injury for the Browns' game 
in Jacksonville on Sunday. If he can't go, Mark Campbell would be the backup 
tight end, and if Aaron Shea is also out, then Marc Edwards would serve as 
Campbell's backup for the second straight game. We don't recommend any of the 
Browns' tight ends.  

 Bernie Parmalee , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Parmalee has been surprisingly productive over the past two weeks while 
splitting time with Curtis Martin, who has been less than 100 percent after 
injuring his gluteus maximus. Parmalee caught six passes and accounted for 74 
yards of total offense in last week's win over Chicago.  Starting Parmalee in 
the playoffs, however, is extremely risky, so stick with Martin or look to 
another option if possible.    

 Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Browns Coach Chris Palmer hasn't made a final decision on who will start at 
quarterback Sunday against Jacksonville, although if Pederson's bruised ribs 
don't heal in time, it would make the decision an easy one. Pederson was held 
out of throwing drills yesterday and will probably be limited the rest of the 
week, and looks to be a gametime decision. Palmer may opt to use rookie 
Spergon Wynn this week either way. Considering the Browns' struggles in the 
passing game added to this quarterback controversy, Pederson isn't going to 
help Fantasy owners during the playoffs.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 According to The Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals are planning on 
evaluating Mitchell over the next few games in hopes that he will re-sign to 
compete with Akili Smith for the starting QB job next season. Team president 
Mike Brown made the statements after watching Mitchell participate in his 
first practice in 10 days yesterday. Mitchell is expected to start Sunday 
against Arizona after missing last Sunday's game with a sprained knee 
ligament. Despite a weak Cardinals' defense, we don't recommend him for your 
league's playoff run.   

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Sanders is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Bengals 
with a quadricep injury.  The injury certainly hasn't helped his numbers - he 
has caught only five passes for 63 yards in his last two games.  Avoid 
starting Sanders if at all possible, especially during the playoffs.  He is 
far too inconsistent to play at such a crucial stage of your Fantasy 
season.     

 David Boston , WR ARI - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Boston caught only one pass for 32 yards in last week's loss to the Giants.  
He has been hampered by a nagging hamstring injury of late, which hasn't help 
his numbers in recent weeks.  He has had only one game with more than 90 
yards receiving in the last six weeks, and has scored only once in that same 
span. If the Cards' enemic offense is ever going to score, however, it could 
be against the Bengals. Unless you have more solid receivers on your roster, 
starting Boston simply on this week's matchup isn't a bad move.     

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Hearst is listed as questionable on the injury report but won't be of any 
help to a Fantasy team this season.  He was recently activated from the 
injury list after missing most 1999 and 2000 with an ankle injury.    

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/30/00 
 Moore has been downgraded to questionable on the injury report.  He suffered 
a shoulder stinger in Sunday's game against St. Louis.  If he is unable to 
play Chad Morton and Terry Allen will handle the carries.  The Saints have 
been able to run on every team they have played this season no matter who 
their RB is.  But if you are going to use a New Orleans back go with Morton 
who is the healthiest and most explosive of the bunch.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 Jones could see some increased playing time now that the season is coming to 
a close, but he will still have little impact for Fantasy owners at this 
point in the season. Jones' rookie campaign has been a real disappointment, 
and he should have been a casuality for owners much earlier in the year.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Pittman had a huge game against the Giants last week, catching ten passes 
while compiling 193 yards of total offense. He also scored the Cardinals' 
only touchdown of the game on a 36-yard pass from Dave Brown. Pittman will 
face a Cincinnati defense this week that ranks 24th in the league against the 
run, so he could be in line for another strong performance. The only thing 
that Fantasy owners who have Pittman on their roster should worry about is if 
Arizona decides to give rookie Thomas Jones more playing time now that the 
season is winding down.   

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Rams are expected to decide on Thursday whether or not Wilkins is 
healthy enough to play.  He will undergo an extensive kicking routine and 
will be evaluated from thereafter.  Wilkins has missed the past few games 
because of a quadriceps injury.  

 Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Hayes practiced Wednesday and will likely play in Sunday's game against the 
Rams.  He missed Monday's game against the Rams due to a groin injury.  Hayes 
hasn't been a star by no means this season but he has been helpful to Fantasy 
teams.    

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 11/30/00 
 It looks like rookie Brad Hoover will start at RB again this Sunday for the 
Panthers.  Biakabutuka has been sidelined for the past few weeks by turf 
toe.  He was initally listed as probable for Sunday's home game against the 
Rams but left practice early Wednesday after experiencing pain in his toe.  
"I'd say right now his status is probably a little more questionable than I 
thought it would be," head coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer . 
 It would be wise to keep Biakabutuka out of your lineup.  Although Hoover 
had a good game this week it might even be safer to use a more proven back on 
your Fantasy team.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Wheatley practiced on Wednesday and is listed as probable for this week's 
game against the Steelers. Head Coach Jon Gruden said that Wheatley moved 
around well during the workout, so expect the Raiders' back to be ready to 
play. Wheatley has proven that he has a high tolerance for pain, so even if 
he isn't 100 percent for the Pittsburgh game, Fantasy owners can rest assured 
that he will play.     

 Herbert Goodman , RB GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Packers have activated Goodman from their practice squad.  He had played 
in five games this season before being placed on the practice team on 
November 1.  He is used primarily on special teams and will be of little use 
to a Fantasy team at this point in the year.   

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now 
recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.  He still hopes to return 
for a December 10 game against the Lions.  Right now he is having trouble 
pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league 
until next season.     

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England.  Although he is still listed as 
questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is 
optimistic. "Right now, I'd say he'll play," said Cunningham, "but we'll see 
what (today) brings." Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it 
would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - 
especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.    

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he 
missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously 
optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo. 
Despite experiencing a slight "tweak" in the hamstring after Wednesday's 
practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. "I feel fine," Smith 
said, "I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain."  
Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be 
wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could 
hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this 
point of the season.     

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now "optimistic" that Fiedler 
will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He 
took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice 
and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for 
Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. "If he's OK 
(today), he's starting," said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does 
start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have 
advanced to their league's playoffs.     

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.  Where have we heard 
this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised 
to run over the opposition.  He looked slow carrying the ball this season and 
was replaced at HB by James Allen.  With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, 
Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.  He is down to 242 
pounds already and would like to reach 235.  Even if he does reach this goal 
don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a 
star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.     

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's 
game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.  It 
appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  His seperated shoulder 
rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was 
healthy he didn't produce too much.    

More Updates 

 Player News?Teams? 
 Meximullets Player News 

 Charlie Garner , Active RB Updated 11/13/00 
Garner emerged from a two-week slump by gaining 102 yards on 25 carries and 
scoring a touchdown. Look for Garner to have a big game next week against a 
thin Atlanta Falcons defense. 

 Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 11/22/00 
Freeman had a relatively quiet game Sunday against the Colts catching only 
three passes for 37 yards. He did manage to haul in a 17-yard TD pass from 
Brett Favre. No. 2 receiver Bill Schroeder won't have the game that he had 
last week, which will allow the mediocre Panthers' secondary to focus on 
stopping Freeman. His numbers will improve this week but only slightly. 

 Skip Hicks , Reserve RB Updated 10/17/00 
Hicks saw limited action in Sunday's game against the Ravens. He rushed three 
times for seven yards and caught one pass for five yards. Unless Stephen 
Davis goes down, Hicks won't see much action. 

 Amani Toomer , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 
Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last Sunday 
night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented Redskins' 
secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 yards in the 
team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable matchups 
this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer. 

 Justin Watson , Reserve RB Updated 11/13/00 
Watson fared better in his second start for Marshall Faulk Sunday. He gained 
62 yards on 17 carries. 

 Shawn Bryson , Reserve RB Updated 11/17/00 
With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the start 
this week against the Chiefs. If Morris has been one of your main tailbacks 
this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available. 

 Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 
Torry Holt caught six passes for 89 yards against the Saints Sunday. Look for 
Holt to put up similar numbers against the Panthers Sunday. 

 Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 
McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total 
offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put 
the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in 
first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee 
squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect 
huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point 
of Philadelphia's offense once again. 

 Kyle Brady , Active TE Updated 10/30/00 
Brady finally found the end zone, scoring a touchdown in what was a career 
game for him against Dallas Sunday. Just one week after an eight-catch, 
111-yard performance against Washington, Brady broke loose for 10 catches for 
138 yards. Keep in mind that he's been getting opportunities lately due to 
the injury to Jimmy Smith, so his numbers shouldn't remain so extraordinary, 
but Mark Brunell will likely look to his tight end more often in the future. 

 Gary Anderson , Active K Updated 11/29/00 
Anderson continued his accuracy this season by making both of his attempts on 
Thanksgiving Day. He has made 20-of-21 attempts this season and is quietly 
having a year similar to the one he had in 1998 when he was perfect in the 
regular season. However, he is old and doesn't kick the long ones like he 
used to. Anderson won't go beyond 50 yards anymore but is pinpoint from 30-49 
yards. Look for him to add a few more field goals against the Lions this 
week. 

 Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 11/28/00 
Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in 
this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants. Davis missed last 
week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm. 
The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, 
especially with the playoffs just around the corner. 

 Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 11/29/00 
Head coach Steve Mariucci is considering giving Garcia's backups Rick Mirer 
and Tim Rattay some playing time at the end of games to evaluate their 
standing with the team. This won't hurt Garcia's production too much but 
could cost him a few cheap TDs at the end of games. "We've talked about it," 
Mariucci told the Contra Costa Times . "I wouldn't mind Rick Mirer playing a 
little bit, either. ... If a situation presented itself when you could put 
your third guy (Rattay) in there without hurting the football team, I guess 
we would consider that." 

 Bill Schroeder , Reserve WR Updated 11/20/00 
The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches. He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday. 

 Darnell Autry , Reserve RB Updated 11/27/00 
On nine carries, Autry gained just 25 yards. If you start him at anytime 
during the Fantasy playoffs, you may be risking your season. 

 Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 
Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. 
While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 
receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five 
contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one 
touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane 
Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another 
week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. 

 Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 
Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye. 

 Redskins , Active DT Updated 11/17/00 
The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside 
linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the 
Rams. Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, while Barber 
has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee. Washington will 
need a big performance from their defense on Monday night if they are to have 
any chance at beating the champs in the dome.

Randy, I tried to send you a note about a week ago about my elk hunt but it came back undelivered.  I thought you might have changed your address.  Guess I typed it in by mistake. (age does that to you sometimes).  Yes, things are stressful, but as you eluded to God doesnt give His kids a spirit of fear, but confidence that He is in control.  I never thought I d see the Enron empire tumble, but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough, eventually it gives up and surrenders.  There is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the Enron umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of Enron.  Transwestern is definately a money making asset, and that is what may keep me afloat.  Well see.  Anyway, as long as I keep my focus on Jesus and keep reminding myself of that which is important (family and health) I know Ill come through all of this.

Sorry to hear that there is the word "reorganization"  in Hess.  this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive.  I hate this kind of stuff. I know that change is inevitable, but so disruptive.  Ill keep you in prayer. Isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough God, that He can handle all our problems?  Keep the faith......my friend and focus on the eternal.  Just like Peter wrote, were just pilgrims in a foregin land, waiting for the trip home and promise of Christ's return.

Larry, 
I have been thinking of you a lot with all of the Enron stuff going on.  You
and your family are in my prayers because I know what a strain this kind of
uncertainty can put on a person.  We are also facing layoffs this coming
January.  We have a new president and are going through a restructuring.  So
we are all uncertain if we will have a job this coming February.  Keep me
posted on how things are going with you.  I will be praying for you.  At
least we have the knowledge that God is in control and that nothing happens
to us that is not first filtered through His everlasting love.

Your brother,
Randy

The renaming and moving of the O:\Pulp&Paper directory to O:\Industrial Markets\Forest Products may have caused some problems to those files which have macros that are still looking for the O:\Pulp&Paper directory.
 
If you have a model, graph, spreadsheet which was affected and need help, we have a solution available.  All we need to know is what files to fix.  So if you're experiencing a #Ref! error or anything relating to linkage to O:\Pulp&Paper, please let me know and we'll resolve it as soon as possible.
 
Thanks,
Avril
