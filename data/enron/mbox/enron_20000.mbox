We are still wating on Bankruptcy court to decide our future.  The Dynegy deal fell through a couple of months ago.  My division (trading ops) will most likely be sold to either UBS or Citigroup.

Keep in touch.

Eric,

Thanks for the Congrats.  Sorry I didn't get to see ya,  it'd been 6 months 
since I'd gotten to see Marilyn and we had to go through the "rough 
re-acclimation" period so once we got over it we wanted to spend all our 
remaining time together.  The holiday bowl did in fact rock, I look forward 
to next season.  How are you hangnin with this Enron fiasco?  You workin fer 
Dynergy now?

We're rollin to the field tomorrow, I'll drop ya a note when we get out.

Take Care,

Brett.

Don,

As we discussed, can you please provide some comments on each of the ADM locations listed on the attachment below.  Some thoughts on the difficulty of moving power in each area (ie transmission availability) as well as the general market conditions and opportunities in each would be helpful.  Also, any comments on how difficult the utility involved is to deal with would be good.  The intention is to pick one or more sites for a trial management deal with ADM.

Thanks,

Tom.

Bret:

Thanks again for taking time to meet with Tom May, Terri Clynes and me
regarding Enron's power services products on June 27.

I would like to firm a date for our follow up meeting. We had discussed
your coming to Houston to meet at our office on Tuesday
July 24. Does that date work for you ? I would propose flying down the
night before. We could meet in the morning then play golf in
the afternoon followed by dinner at Cafe Annie (one of Houston's best).
Alternatively, you could fly down Tuesday morning for an
afternoon meeting followed by dinner, cigars, etc. Let me know what
works best.

In addition, we had discussed 6 facilities to look at for potential
services trials. They were Southport, Peoria, Clinton, Cedar Rapids,
Decatur and Des Moines. Can you provide the following information by
facility:

1. plant demand
2. generation capability
3. utility tariff facility is under
4. does facility have an interconnect agreement
5.    "       "        "    real-time metering
6. what is the voltage level of the interconnection

If you could provide this information in advance of the July 24 meeting,
we can perform some critical initial due diligence. Let me know
if the July 24 date works for you.


Regards,   Ed

All, 

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotations for the internal new hires to the Trading Track.    I will be meeting with the new TT A&A tomorrow, and subject to them signing all associated documentation, they will join the Track immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions with respect to the rotations outlined and we can make the appropriate changes as we move forward.

Congratulations!   If you're still reading this late in the season, 
you're likely in your playoffs (and well on your way to winning your 
league...)   We've said all along that it's you guys who make the 
site what it is.  We want to show our appreciation and give you guys 
some due props.   
 
Beginning Monday, we'll be accepting teams for display on our 
Footballguys Wall of Champions.   In this wacky season, making the 
playoffs is a feat in itself and we'll be displaying teams that make 
their playoffs as well as league winners.
 
Here's a chance to boast a little and rub it in the faces of your 
leaguemates who're on the sidelines watching as you battle for the 
league championship.
 
See the site for details.
 
Joe and David

*******************************************

and now onto the news:



Quarterbacks in the News:

Rob Johnson (Buf) is out.  

Scott Mitchell (Cin) injured himself in Wednesday's practice and
is now doubtful for this weekend.

Cincinnati has signed Scott Covington.  He will backup Jon Kitna this 
week.

Gus Frerotte (Den) has been placed on I/R and is out for the rest of 
the season.  In related news, the team signed Todd Husak for the 
remainder of the season.

Mark Brunell (Jac) is expected to practice on Thursday.  He appears 
on the injury report as probable with a sore quadriceps. 

Daunte Culpepper (Min) underwent surgery and is likely lost for the 
season.  Todd Bouman will start in his place.  He is nursing a 
sprained ligament in the thumb of his throwing hand, but is expected 
to play on Sunday. 

Jeff Garcia (SF) was held out of practice on Wednesday and may be 
rested this week.  He appears on the injury report as questionable 
with sore ribs.  Jeff would like to play, but coach Steve Mariucci is 
considering resting Jeff so that he is closer to 100% for the 
playoffs.  This would seem to make sense since the Rams have likely 
locked up winning the Division.  The 49ers believe they will need a 
healthy, scrambling Jeff Garcia to go deep into the post season.  If 
Jeff does not play, look for Tim Rattay to get the start.    

Steve McNair (Ten), despite being listed on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore back is expected to start.  

*******************************************

Running Backs in the News:

Maurice Smith (Atl) continues to battle through cartilage damage in 
his knee.  He is expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable.

Terry Allen (Bal) will start for the Ravens this week.  Moe Williams 
will back him up and see plenty of action. 

Jason Brookins (Bal) is out and will not play.

Shawn Bryson (Buf) will start this week.  Travis Henry is listed as 
out with a bad knee.  Sammy Morris will spell Shawn.

James Jackson (Cle) is out this week and is likely going to miss the 
remainder of the season with his bad ankle.  Jamel White and Ben Gay 
will both see duty in this week's game.

James Stewart (Det) practiced on Wednesday and likely will start on 
Sunday.

Ahman Green (GB) did not complete the full practice on Wednesday, but 
he is expected to play on Sunday.

Fred Taylor (Jac) continues to show up on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore groin, but do not look for him to play any 
time soon.  The injury is significantly worse than the team has let 
on.

Elvis Joseph (Jac) has a sore shoulder, but is expected to backup 
Stacey Mack.

Priest Holmes (KC) was excused from practice today.  He is expected 
to practice the rest of the week and will start on Sunday.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable with a pulled groin.

Rob Konrad (Mia) has a stiff neck, but is expected to play on 
Saturday against the Patriots.

Jim Kleinsasser (Min) will play through his sprained ankle.  

Ricky Williams (NO) is expected to start despite a hairline crack to 
one of his ribs.  He appears on the injury report as questionable.  

Jon Ritchie (Oak) is expected to play if needed.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable with a sore ankle.

Jerome Bettis (Pit) missed practice Wednesday.  He is listed as 
doubtful on the injury report with a pulled groin.

Amos Zereoue (Pit) missed practice Wednesday.  He is expected to 
contribute on Sunday as a backup to Chris Fuamatu Ma'afala
despite being listed as questionable with a sore shoulder.

Terrell Fletcher (SD) is out with a bad hamstring.  LaDainian 
Tomlinson will carry the running game like most weeks.

Warrick Dunn (TB) will play with turf toe.  He appears on the injury 
report as probable.

Skip Hicks (Ten) is expected to get significant playing time this 
week.  Eddie George will continue to start.

Stephen Davis (Was) did not practice on Wednesday.  He still is 
expected to start, but may be a gametime decision.  He appears on the 
injury report as questionable with a sore knee.  Proceed with caution.

*******************************************

Wide Receivers in the News:

Martay Jenkins (Ari) missed Wednesday's practice with bruised
ribs and a sprained ankle.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable and may be a gametime decision.

Brian Finneran (Atl) is expected to play despite a sore shoulder.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable.

Terance Mathis (Atl) is expected to play through his back pain.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable.

Peerless Price (Buf) was unable to practice Wednesday on his sore 
ankle.  He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a 
sprained ankle.  If he is unable to go, Reggie Germany would get the 
start opposite of Eric Moulds. 

Muhsin Muhammad (Car) skipped Wednesday's practice.  He will
likely be a gametime decision.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore toe.

Bert Emanuel (Det) completed the Wednesday practice and is expected 
to play on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as probable with 
a sore knee.  He has missed the last month and is likely rusty.

Larry Foster (Det) appears on the injury report as questionable with 
a sore thigh.  He was held out of practice on Wednesday.

Terrence Wilkins (Ind) is doubtful with a hamstring injury.  Marvin 
Harrison and Marcus Pollard are likely to get the majority of the 
pass attempts again this week.

Oronde Gadsden (Mia) continues to miss practice and is very 
questionable to play Saturday.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore hamstring.  Rookie Chris Chambers is 
expected to start in his place. 

James McKnight (Mia) has a sore back, but is expected to start 
opposite of Chris Chambers.  He is listed as probable on the injury 
report.

Cris Carter (Min) hinted to reporters that this is likely his final 
season in the NFL.  Of course he said all those things last year, but 
no one is now believing this team is very close to winning a 
Superbowl soon.   

Terry Glenn (NE) is expected to see increased playing time on 
Saturday.

Santana Moss (NYJ) was able to practice Wednesday, but is not likely 
to make a big impact this week.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore knee.  Wayne Chrebet and Lavernues Coles 
remain the starters.

Ike Hilliard (NYG) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to start on 
Sunday.

Joe Jurevicius (NYG) practiced on Wednesday.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable with a sore hamstring.  He is expected to 
play on Sunday.

Todd Pinkston (Phi) is expected to play despite a bruised shoulder.  
He appears on the injury report as probable.

James Thrash (Phi) is nursing sore ribs, but is expected to start as 
usual.  He appears on the injury report as probable.

Tim Dwight (SD) is out with Pneumothorax.  And No, I do not have a 
clue what that is.

Terrell Owens (SF) missed practice on Wednesday as he has the last 
few weeks.  He is expected to practice the rest of the week and start 
as usual.  He appears on the injury report as probable with a bruised 
hip.

Isaac Bruce (StL) is expected to start despite a sore foot.  He is 
listed on the injury report as probable.

Jacquez Green (TB) did not practice on Wednesday.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable with a bruised hip.

Keyshawn Johnson (TB) was able to practice on Wednesday.  He is 
expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as 
probable with a sprained ankle.

Justin McCareins (Ten) is out this week.

Chris Sanders (Ten) was able to practice on Wednesday, but will 
likely be inactive for Saturday's game.  He appears on the injury 
report as questionable with a sore back.

*******************************************

Tight Ends in the News:

Shannon Sharpe (Bal) is expected to start despite a bruised leg.  

Wesley Walls (Car) was able to do light running on Wednesday, but 
remains very questionable for Sunday.

Fred Baxter (Chi) is expected to play despite a sore knee.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable.

Aaron Shea (Cle) appears on the injury report as questionable.  OJ 
Santiago is expected to start as usual.

Bubba Franks (GB) did not practice on Wednesday, but is expected to 
play on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as probable with a 
sprained ankle.

Todd Rutledge (NE) is expected to play despite a sore ankle.

Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play on Saturday despite a pulled 
groin.

Greg Clark (SF) is out this week.  Eric Johnson continues to start in 
his place.

Stephen Alexander (Was) was able to do light running on Wednesday, 
but he is not expected to play this weekend.  He appears on the 
injury report as doubtful.  Zeron Flemister will start in his place.  
Walter Rasby, who has a sore ankle, will also see some action.

*******************************************

Kickers in the News:

Bill Gramatica (Ari) suffered a torn ACL after celebrating upon a 
successful FG attempt.  Cedric Oglesby do the kicking this week.

Mike Vanderjagt (Ind) is expected to play despite a sore knee.

Sebastian Janikowsi (Oak) missed practice on Monday, Tuesday and 
Wednesday citing personal reasons.  He is expected to practice the 
rest of the week and play on Sunday.

Jose Cortez (SF) worked on making an adjustment to his form this week 
in an effort to improve upon his accuracy.  He is not in any danger 
of losing his job despite poor performances as of late.

Dave Delaney and Jim Fallon need the following information for a meeting tomorrow at noon.   They need to know which BU all ENW and ISC employees support (i.e. EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, and ENA). 
I've provided all the employees that remain in the estate in the spreadsheet below for you.   There's a tab for each of you with all of your Estate employees listed.    Please designate which company each employee supports and return by 11 AM tomorrow.   
I apologize for the short notice. 
Thanks for your help.

perfection, a majority of the grapes for Turning Leaf were selected
from some of the finest vineyards in the Lodi region. A major
winegrape-growing region since the 1850s, Lodi is increasingly
looked to by leading California wineries for grapes of superior
quality. The warm days and cool nights of its Mediterranean climate
allow the grapes to develop excellent color and maintain crisp acid
levels through to harvest. The end result is a well-balanced

FYI - Sounds as if we can't delay Tom's residence in the flat any longer.  We 
have pushed the date several times.  If there are some other delays, you may 
want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then 
returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from 
that time period.  What do you think?  Can we assure Tom that you will be out 
of the flat by the 18th of May?  --Sally

Sally,

I need Tom over here ASAP. The flat was given to Todd on the understanding 
that Tom would have it at the start of May. Its now been extended to 18th 
May. I don't wan't to postpone Tom's transfer any longer. Please can you give 
me assurance that Todd will vacate by his newdate of the 18th May.

Thanks

Subject: Re: Move  

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict "two full working days" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

Tom,

I just heard today that you're not arriving until the 18th as Todd Hall is in 
the apartment. Please let me know what is going on - this is the first I 
heard, and I think its a bit late considering I thought you'd be here today 
!!!!

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Guys, with respect to the above, as you know, WGR was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated.  I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know.....

Along with Mike McConnell, I am active in recruiting for Enron's Analyst 
Program at the University of Oklahoma.  We became involved in recruiting 
there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program 
that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.  OU transformed 
their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management 
Program in the School of Business.  This undergraduate degree retains the 
geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM 
program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a 
trading floor course.  With the added plus of many of these students growing 
up in or around "energy" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that 
recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.  Our 
recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy 
Management graduates have done well at Enron.  

Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody 
Crook.  He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 
graduation.  His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book 
administrator in gas trading.  He is in the process of looking for a second 
rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you 
should consider for a rotation on your team.  In addition to this last year's 
risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for 
Burlington Resources.  

I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.  I think very highly of him, 
and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program.  
His background and your business seem to be a good fit.  Please visit with 
Jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.  It will be well worth your 
time.  

Thanks.

SInce you unfortunately made an unnecessary trip into the office yesterday during your vacation, I assume that you are perhaps out of the office today finishing that vacation.  I am certainly looking for your list of additional items/projects that you believe need to be added to or made more explicit in the draft document for Project Greenlight.  I have rescheduled a meeting with Rick Buy for next Friday, October 12 at 11:30. I hope that you will be able to attend.  I want to be certain that we have enough time to review your comments and concerns, reconvene the appropriate group of steering committee members and/or project managers, and make any necessary changes or additions to the document before that meeting. 

I will be out of the office on Monday, taking Meagan to SMU for Mustang Monday - it's her one day off this fall for a teacher in-service day and nicely enough coincides with a scheduled day at SMU for high school seniors to visit.  I will be checking my e-mails when I get home that night, however.  

Sally

Diana-

   I have not heard an answer from Gwen yet on those PMA's, but I am working with risk and I have let Fran know that I am looking into this so as not to hit your DPR twice.  I'll let you know once I have heard from everyone.

  Thanks for your patience,

Why One Firm Thinks Enron Is Running Out of Gas
By Peter Eavis 
Senior Columnist
Originally posted at 5:23 PM ET 5/9/01 on RealMoney.com










A small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is telling 
clients to quickly dump Enron (ENE:NYSE - news), believing that the energy 
trading giant's 2001 earnings will fall well short of Wall Street's 
forecasts. 
Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Roberts, thinks 
Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus estimate of 
$1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $30, nearly 50% 
below Wednesday's $59.20. 
The firm's 26-page report, published May 6, highlights Enron's declining 
profitability and increasing leverage and suggests that the company should 
trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS
:NYSE - news), which has a 2001 price-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 
33 times. OWS also alleges that Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key 
parts of its financial statements are confusing and opaque. 
Houston-based Enron didn't comment by publication time on elements of the 
report that Detox sent the company. An energy analyst who is bullish on 
Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains fundamental misunderstandings 
about the energy market and Enron's business model, but he says the report 
does include some ground-breaking and valid insights. (The analyst's firm 
doesn't give stock recommendations.) 
Economies of Scale
Why care what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analysts at Merrill 
Lynch (MER:NYSE - news)? For one, OWS has an excellent track record. 
Particularly sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing 
down. It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve, recommending 
that clients sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN:Nasdaq - news) in June 1999, 
when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and their prices at their 
most insane. 




Pulling Back
Enron retreats after long rally


Enron, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annual revenue of 
over $100 billion and impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ranked 
alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a 
precipitous drop nonetheless. Why? 
OWS's main beef is that key profitability measures are in decline. Margins on 
Enron's pretax operating earnings (which the company's earnings releases call 
IBIT, or income before interest, taxes and other items) are falling. Total 
IBIT of $795 million in the first quarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 
billion in revenue for the period, compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth 
quarter and 4.75% in the year-earlier period. Revenue in the first quarter 
was nearly quadrupled from the year-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. 
This shrinkage is due to lower-margin trading income making up an 
increasingly large share of Enron's revenue base. 
OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 2001 Enron needs to generate an 
extra $2.1 billion in revenue for each additional penny it makes over its 
2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79. 
The energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasn't grasped how Enron can 
continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply by 
increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size. In other words, 
margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings still go 
up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahead of 
the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percentage 
points. The analyst thinks Enron will make $1.82 per share in 2001. 
Growing On You
In addition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so helped Enron is 
likely to continue for several years, according to the analyst. He notes that 
roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. still isn't traded in a 
market. "Eventually it will be part of a competitive environment, but it'll 
take five to 10 years," says the analyst. And he believes the extreme 
volatility in energy-related commodities that has also benefited Enron will 
exist for longer than OWS projects. 
Still, OWS's point on profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. 
Return on capital (net income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% 
in 2000, down on 1999's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at 
Duke (DUK:NYSE - news) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news) (12.1%) and even 
Goldman (8.9%). 
Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow. For 
example, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesale services, or 
trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the 
company's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron's 
related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities that 
have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related entities that 
Enron has traded with is headed by Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow. The energy 
analyst comments: "Why are they doing this? It's just inappropriate." 
The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deals has been 
a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical fiber 
to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second quarter 
of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-called dark fiber (optical cable 
without the gear to send data over it) transaction allowed Enron to beat 
analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rather than 
missing by 2 cents. 
How soon before Wall Street follows Off Wall Street on Enron?

Kevin:  Rob Benson called me this morning to ask about the process for Permanent Residency (Green Card).  At this time, I have been asked to hold on all new Green Card applications until further notice.

However, we might want to amend Rob's visa status from L1B to L1A, making it easier, faster and cheaper to process the Green Card, hopefully in the near future.

Rob was originally brought into the US in the capacity of Associate and this is why we used the L1B visa and not the L1A at that time.  Now that he is a Director, we should be able to amend his visa to L1A.  (The L1A is usually for Managers or above, or someone managing a function).

Do I have your authority to go ahead with the amendment?  The approximate cost is $1,000.

Thank you
Margaret

If you don't know about the NNG quality posting that's probably a good sign that it hasn't been posted yet.  I'm hoping to have a conversation with Mary Kay tomorrow before its posted. Thanks.  Get back to your kid stuff now!

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.  

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, 
but don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid 
Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between 
two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  

 Sylvester Morris , WR KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the 
Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. "I 
missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, 
but it's still a long season," he said. "It's not so bad physically. But 
every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college. In 
college, you could schedule your classes. I never had a class before 10 
o'clock. Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day. That's a 
difference."

Mike,

I spoke with Steve Sweeney at Cogentrix today regarding this spreadsheet, and he would like to see our data for every day from June 1, 2001 through September 30, 2001 as you calculated for the few random days throughout the summer.  The spreadsheet seems to indicate that we did not allocate Cogentrix on some of the days in question.  This information is contrary to the information Steve provided and must be explored further. 

Steve is getting impatient with this process.  He would like to see this come to a resolution as soon as possible.  I said that I understand his concern and we will do our best to resolve this in a timely matter.  

Kent, once Mike finishes the spreadsheet, I recommend that we meet and discuss our offer to Cogentrix.

I know you are both busy.  Lots of push back from London on Doorstep Reviews.  I recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now.  However, it is London's normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing.  I think that they view being a subject of a Doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part.  

Next week I will follow up with you to get your thoughts on Doorstep efforts during the 4th quarter.  Wanted you to see my reply to Fernley below.  --Sally

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

The EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.

I'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.

Thanks

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

We will not be there next week so that should be fine.  Are the complex derivatives group and 'structured book' run by Paul Darcy the same thing?  If yes, then we are planning on reviewing that area.  Should I contact Paul Darcy directly?  If no, what is the complex derivatives group?

Thanks,

Also in addition can you please confirm that you are not doing the complex derivatives group which is run totally separately in both personnel and risk terms ?

James,

Just a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing.  Please provide a list of books, curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power.  In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.

Please provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.

Stacey

All:  

As part of the TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Hearing, it has been suggested that the following modification to CAS and other associated systems be made:

EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a receipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested shipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it doesn't provide the IS's the "last look" auction their looking for, it at least provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if capacity is available (eliminates any claim of "tortious process"); disadvantage: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time).

This was drafted by an attorney without considerable consultation with Gas Logistics.  

A settlement offer that includes minor tariff changes will be provided to the parties in the proceeding this week.  Although this will buy some time, a scope and cost estimate needs to be determined so that if the modification above is offered, we know what the cost is.    

Alma:  Please schedule a 1 hour meeting with anyone on the distribution and if anyone else should be included, please let Alma know.  

Brad

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Under the OWBPA or one of the laws similar to it, we have to present 
statistics to the employees over 40 who were offered the package.  Gloria, 
could you pull together two lists: one would have the names, titles and ages 
of everyone offered the package (Mo and the FX guys) and the other list will 
be the names, titles and ages of everyone else in the US in Enron Metals 
(including ST. Louis and Chicago but excluding Los Angeles), the people who 
were not offered it.  I know that we do not have titles for some of the 
Rudolph wolff folks at this time; please try to get their old titles at RW 
from the RW HR guy and we will use them.  We will need to submit this to 
Michelle Cash soon; we have to give that data to Mo before we can finalize 
his package.

Thanks

I suggest using the entire New York office as the group.  It really doesn't 
matter because the bulk of the people being offered the packages are under 
40, so our statistics look good either way.  Michelle

Michelle, you define the NYC office as the group, and not the FX/Bullion 
traders as the group?  would it look better to show a small group, with 
almost all of them terminated, or a big group with only a few terminated?

Hoyt,

As we discussed, even though Mo and Penner are not part  of this initial 
round, to be on the safe side, we should provide them with data regarding all 
persons in the group (defined as the New York office) who are provided with a 
release and those who are not.  The data should include age and title of 
persons offered packages, and then a separate list of age and titles of 
persons who are not offered packages.

Once this data is pulled together, I will be happy to review it to ensure 
compliance with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act, as the DOL has 
interpreted it.

Thanks.

Michelle

In case you have your blackberry with you while in line with the masses, just learned from Brent Price (via Mike McConnell) that there is a daily meeting led by JIm Fallon with CEO's at 11:00 that reviews cash usage within the businesses and where a list, although not final, is being reviewed relative to lines of business and locations (i.e. Tokyo, Singapore, etc.) that may be exited.  It is key for ENW to anticipate these changes and seems that we could add something to the discussions from time to time.  Did you know about this meeting?  Seems like you should be there.  Can you nose in with Jim?  --Sally

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists w=
ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=
ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California=
 - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=
idge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

I have selected December 7th and 8th as the days for us to get together in 
the Houston office to go over your year.  I will be able to retrieve your 
completed feedback reports by then and hopefully will have spoken to your 
supervisor.  Please send me your availability for those two days.  I will 
need 30 minutes but we should schedule for an hour. Be patient, I am between 
jobs and am my own assistant.  If you cannot meet on either day, (if you are 
in Brazil, for instance) we will work something out. (send a suggestion or 
two)  Please respond to this as soon as possible so I can get everyone 
scheduled.  Thanks

PS Please make sure you are sending emails to Don Black / SA/   not to Don

Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called "glut" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
"fiber glut?"  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is "dark" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has "ten-bagger" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  It's yours FREE, simply for accepting
a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

Sincerely,

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic is
DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.
Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.

Dear Martin Cuilla,

I promised to keep you informed and wanted to provide an update on the
situation surrounding Flight 587. The National Transportation Safety
Board investigation is still underway, with both the cockpit voice and
flight data recorders being analyzed for clues about the cause of the
accident.

In addition to our normal aircraft inspection program, and as purely a
precautionary measure, we have begun a voluntary inspection of all tail
fins on the Airbus A300 fleet.  The inspection process started on
Thursday and should be concluded next week. We have completed
approximately 25% of the inspections. While we don't anticipate any
problems, we certainly want to look at any and all possibilities for
the accident's cause.  When the inspection is finished we will
communicate those results.

On behalf of all of us at American Airlines, I want to thank everyone
for the outpouring of support we've received following Monday's
tragedy. We are heartened by the many notes of care and concern. The
unprecedented actions over the past 60 days have tested the entire
nation in a way that could not be envisioned prior to September 11. 

I hope that you find these communications informative. It is my pledge
to you to keep you informed of not only issues surrounding the accident
but also security and airport process measures that we are implementing
across our system.

On behalf of the 100,000 employees at American, TWA and American Eagle,
thanks for your support.

Sincerely, 

Mike Gunn
Executive Vice President
American Airlines

Enron Troubles Only the Tip of the Iceberg?

Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) reputation and crushed its stock, but it looks like that case is far from unique. 
The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities, according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron. Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. 
The extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. 
Enron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
Ten Long Days
Enron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. 
The turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.

However, Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities. The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. 
Among ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. 
Demands, Demands
Rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. 
If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
Friday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. 
This week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the "market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets." He added: "It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets." 
McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. 

Under The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb

While the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. 
What's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, "I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe." 
Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. 
The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. 
Now, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. 
The Company's Challenge
But what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. 
"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months," says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. "We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery." 
Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. 
Straightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. 
Although Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. 
The divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. 
The credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. 
Frankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. "If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy," Dietert says. "In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow." 
It's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. 
There's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, "Why? Ask why." 
Investors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer.

DJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)

   By Kristen McNamara 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday. 

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from New England's market. 

  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said. 

  "I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, "and it's never
been in the news," said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. "My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion." 

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices. 

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,
to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. 

  "Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit," Mahoney said. 

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default. 

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said. 

  "I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance," Doot said. "Those things have in fact
happened from time to time."

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit
alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed
Internet service in some U.S. regions.

     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron
provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in
the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.
operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.

     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to
offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is
making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.

     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers,'' Visse said.

     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,
did not immediately return calls for comment.

                         The Agreement

     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide
bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron
isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if
Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow
Jones newswire reported.

     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal, Dow reported.

     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23
letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't
provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing
Microsoft to recover damages.

     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents
to $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder
suing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.

     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,
Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff
McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices
this week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm
Abbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such
as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.

     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who
is suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity.

     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according
to Texas secretary of state records.

     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment
about the document requests.

     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer
said. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates.

                       Affiliates Have Debts

     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
Frevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations.

     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates.

     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books.

     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets
don't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has
said.

                            Few Answers

     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call Tuesday.

     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to
questions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.

     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as
officers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC. The entire
Enron board is also listed.

     Shares of Enron $1.15 to $15.20 in late trading.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

     (Adds investor comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans.

     The company's stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents,
or 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors
said. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,
where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.

     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth
Third Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of
management.''

      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

                            Bonds Drop

     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1
1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''
yield 9.53 percent.

     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit
rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses
from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions.

     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart
financial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's
Investors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the
hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital.''

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

                         Other Liabilities

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holdings of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have
Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's
lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones
Rating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''
one notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a
statement.

Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. 
The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.
On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking "non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share," in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. 
If you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. 
Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.

Hi Cindy,

I know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things....so just drop me an email when you get a chance.

For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb.  (unsual bonus time).  Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead.  I can't seem to get back into the system to change this.   ????

Attached are my final comments.  They deal more with the proposal to curtail exports (including muni).  I don't really care if we file this with the material we have already put together, or do something with it separately.  With respect to the ATC and TTC questions we were addressing earlier, I haven't added anything to what Steve put together.  The CAISO's argument about restricting ATC because of Path 15 congestion, because, as Steve points out, any technical problems would affect both TTC AND ATC.  If anyone has any questions, let me know

I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party.  You are the chosen
few.  The cruise is set for Sat. Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.
Transportation will be arranged for you.  We need to leave at about 5 pm on
the 19th.  I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future
e-mail.  The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already
so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that
money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the
Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.

Let me know if you have any questions.

-Eric

Three heavily Democratic counties continue to handcount
ballots that were meant to be counted by machine.

As the process continues, it has become apparent why
machines are used to count these ballots.

There have been reports of Bush ballots in the Gore
pile, counters using ballots as fans, and chads on the
floor and on the counting tables....

Cick here to watch a member of the Miami-Dade County
Canvassing Board bend, scratch, poke and press a
ballot during the manual recount...

Sometimes, a picture is worth a thousand words....

on the bulletin board that I need up so that I can let tenants know about
what is going on.Gave #25 a notice about having to many people staying in
that apt and that problem has been resolved.Also I have a tenant in #29 that
is complaining about #28 using fowl language.I sent #28 a lease violation we
will see how that goes
                                                  call you tomorrow
                                           Thanx Lucy

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

Heard back from Tim. Please plan on attending. Port, Bradford, you and I will attend from RAC. Moody's is having trouble with our loss of $694MM that I told them when they were here. We need to start pulling together explicitly why we lost so much in one day, what the var limits were that day and what has been the experience since then. Tx Rick

Rick,
I have no problem making the trip.  I will leave it to you to consider the resources necessary to give the pitch.  I don't think there is much else that as important.  I have just finished reading the book 'When Genius Failed' about LTCM and, at the end of the day, funding positions through turmoil is almost more important than being right in the first place.  FYI, I will be in Houston on 6/21 for the prc. Originally planned to leave on 6/22.  Could stay through weekend and fly back to London thru NY.
Let me know
Ted

I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how 
you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so 
dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could 
produce that effect.  
The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into 
the winter.

Subject: Stress Test

The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested.  Under the 
$7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price 
curves proportionally shifted.  Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the 
price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX 
volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.


Key findings include:
$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%  
$9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% 

       

It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the 
financial desk actually decreased.  This would seem to imply that up to the 
seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces 
risk).  But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that 
the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and 
increasing VaR by 74%.  Does this make sense or is something else happening?

Frank

Subject:	Ft. Buford Measurement Facilities Agreement - Comments


I went over my Ft. Buford example with Scott.  He is comfortable that the present arrangement is fair to Border.
He was also concerned that NNG should not get into a problem with fuel.  Based on my conversations with Dan Fancler and my knowledge of the PRA process, I believe that fuel is being properly accounted for and retained (assuming Marketing believes that Bearpaw really is selling the gas to other shippers on NBPL who will bring an equivalent amount of gas back to NNG at Ventura or one of the other NNG/NBPL interconnects.)

I'm confused about the proposed Measurement Agreement vs. what we are currently doing.
It appears to change what is currently happening.  Do we want to do that if we think the current arrangement is working?
If so, we need to talk to Dan about how the accounting would need to change.

Paragraph 1:

During the month, the same number is scheduled & confirmed as received at Ft. Buford and delivered to Border, 
with no reduction for fuel & unaccounted for.

When actual measured volumes are available, the total quantity of gas measured through the suction side meters (WBI plus Bearpaw meters) is the quantity deemed to have been received into Fort Buford.  For the  (Bearpaw & whoever is coming in thru WBI), whatever is measured on the suction side is deemed to be delivered to Border with no reduction for fuel.
Any difference between metered receipts and scheduled volumes goes on NNG's OBAs with Bearpaw and WBI.

However, for Border, the actual quantity deemed delivered out of Ft. Buford and into Border is the total receipt quantity LESS 1.66% fuel (which may be change from time to time to reflect the configuration and operation of the station) .  

Paragraph 3.
Northern, not Border, does the fuel calculation.  NNG's measurement system takes the total quantity of gas measured thru the suction side meters less a use and unaccounted percentage (currently 1.66%).  The result becomes the quantity delivered into Border at Ft. Buford.

The calculated fuel amount is booked by Dan Fancler/Kasey Davis as part of the Market Area fuel consumed and is recovered under the PRA as part of NNG's Market Area fuel rate.  

Do we need to provide Border with a month end summary of fuel used if the number we use for their actual delivered volume does not include fuel?

Paragraph 4
(This doesn't affect the agreement, but it's something NNG should consider.)
If NNG makes changes at Ft. Buford to increase the capacity as proposed, won't we need to recalculate the appropriate fuel rate?

Paragraph 5
NNG does not need to reimburse Northern Border for use and unaccounted gas since we deduct the fuel from the number used as the actual delivery to Border at Ft. Buford.

Any difference between the deliveries scheduled into Border and the actual metered volume (less fuel) is booked to the NNG/NBPL OBA at Ft. Buford, netted with amounts on OBAs at the other NBPL/NNG interconnects  and settled in-kind at any of the Parties' interconnects (usually Ventura).

GENERAL
The advantage that I see to the present method is that the volume on the delivery meter at Ft. Buford into Border 
is realistic in that its volume is the receipt volume less our best guess at what is burned at Buford for fuel and never
really reaches Border.

I have not received a call back from Jeff Bartlett, but based on the brochure 
I received from Louise, here is what I understand:

DealBench is a way to streamline processes to efficiently execute 
transactions and distribute deal-related information.  There are 5 platform 
tools - document sharing, multi-media, auctioning, secure communication, and 
deal management.   There are five primary products offered which utilize the 
tools provided...  Bank Products, Structured Products, Commercial Paper, 
Procurement, and Legal Space. 

1) Bank Products - deal management for issuance of debt offerings (credit 
revolvers/secured term-notes) 
2) Structured Products - deal management for initial issuance or re-sale of 
bonds, leveraged leases and other financial transactions
3)  Commercial Paper - deal mgmt for issuance of CP
4)  Procurement - management of wholesale purchasing and selling of various 
products
5)  Legal Space - designed to meet the needs of attorneys at law firms (doc 
sharing, aggregation and organization in a secure environment)

I have a lot of questions for Jeff, so I will send you a quick note when I 
speak to him.

Just got off the phone with the customer.  Seems we were sufficiently off the market that they didn't see any upside in stringing us along.  I told them that the indicative price came from our structuring group and that we would now try to tighten things up directly with the desk.  Ergo, we get another shot.  Let's make it a good one.

We have completed our evaluation of the two proposed structures (1) May

through September and (2) June through August for a three year duration

beginning in 2003.  Unfortunately, based on the prices quoted below, neither

evaluates well enough that we would want to pursue any further.  We

appreciate your interest and remain interested in any future proposals you

may want to offer.

FOR ALL OF US: STAYING YOUNG


1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight, and height.
Let the doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her.


2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.


3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening,
whatever. Never let the brain idle. "An idle mind is the devil's
workshop." The devil's name is Alzheimer's.


4. Enjoy the simple things. When the children are young, that's all you
can afford. When they're in college, that's all you can afford. After you
retire, that's all you can afford!


5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so
much that you can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter.


6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is
with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be alive while you are alive,
don't put out a mailbox on the highway of death and just wait in
residence for your mail.


7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it is family, pets,
keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.


8. Cherish your health. If it's good, preserve it. If it's unstable,
improve it. If it's beyond what you can improve, get help.


9. Don't take guilt trips. Go to the mall, the next county, a foreign
country, but not to guilt country.


10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity.


AND ALWAYS REMEMBER Life is not measured by the number of breaths we
take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

                 -From the Internet - Connie & Tom Silliman

Alan,

Attached is the resume of Charles Glizzard, a candidate that would like to be 
considered for a Global Markets legal position.  We should probably consider 
him for the role of Marine Transportation specialist, but it appears his 
skill set also shows an ability to do quite a bit more for us.

Kind regards,
Dan

I liked the new signs for the new hire network this morning, as opposed to 
the signs for new hire orientation.  Just wanted to let you know that I 
noticed the difference!  I will be curious to hear about changes to the 
content as well.  

Hope your are doing well.  We will have to have lunch after you get through

When entering deals into the P&L please use the drop down box for the 
counterparties.  Rao has developed a comparison activity report that will 
compare enpower to the p&l for us.  If we can enter our deals using the drop 
down  box then he can finish cleaning up the last few bugs so that we can get 
it into production in the next couple of days.

What follows is a memorandum from William J. Museler to me invoking the
Temporary Extraordinary Procedures and requesting me to reissue ECA20000907A.
Immediately following the memorandum is the ECA itself.  It now carries the
number ECA20001208A.  The memorandum and the ECA are also being posted on the
OASIS.



MEMO


Date:          December 8, 2000

From:          William J. Museler, President & Chief Executive Officer

To:       Steven J. Balser, Manager of Market Monitoring and Performance
James H. Savitt, Market Monitor

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:
HAM Transactions Failing Checkout (ECA 20001208A; re-issuance of ECA
20000907A)


Thank  you  for  the  presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance
Unit  and  the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with 
the
Market  Participants  in addressing the market design flaw concerning import 
and
export   transactions,  including  wheel-through  transactions,  that  fail  
the
check-out procedure between the completion of BME and the SCD operating 
hour.  I
am  pleased  that  the  Business  Issues Committee gave unanimous support to 
the
NYISO  to  re-issue ECA 20000907A until the Market Participants can consider 
and
approve,  and  the  NYISO can implement, a tariff change required to 
permanently
address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated in my Memorandum to you of September 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate action, remain at levels different from what would 
otherwise
occur during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20000907A while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208A:

Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout


Applicability

This Extraordinary Correction Action (ECA) shall apply to:

?    Import and export transactions;
?    that are scheduled for an operating hour in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM) 
by
the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME); and
?    that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market
Participant, or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant.

Wheel-through transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export
transaction, and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of 
both
financial impacts, as provided below.  This ECA shall not apply to import,
export, or wheel-through transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or
action, or neighboring control area operator error or action.

Rationale

Import Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME reduces commitments for
energy  resources  within  NYCA  to  accept  scheduled  import transactions 
at a
specific  proxy  bus  indicated  by the Market Participant.  Where the 
scheduled
import  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price 
at
the  proxy  bus  may  be  elevated  above the HAM price due to the failed 
import
transaction.   The  difference  between the real-time price and the BME price 
at
that  proxy  bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the real-time 
market.
Under  this  ECA,  this  amount  (when  positive),  multiplied  by the number 
of
megawatts  of  the  transaction  for  that  hour,  shall be billed to the 
Market
Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial 
impact
of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Export  Transactions:  During the HAM resolution, BME makes commitments for
energy  resources  to  supply  scheduled  export transactions up to the 
purchase
price  indicated  by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus.  
Where
the  scheduled  export  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to 
the
failed  export  transaction.   The  difference  between  the  BME  price and 
the
real-time  price  at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part 
of
Schedule  1  costs.   Under this ECA, this amount (when positive), multiplied 
by
the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour, shall be billed to 
the
Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the 
financial
impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Wheel-Through   Transactions:  During  the  HAM  resolution,  BME  includes
scheduled wheel-through transactions up to the transmission congestion cost 
that
equals  the  decremental  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant.  Where 
the
scheduled  wheel-through transaction fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  both  the  import  and export proxy busses may be elevated 
or
depressed,  respectively,  due  to the effects on transmission congestion of 
the
failed wheel-through transaction.  Under this ECA, the effects of the import 
and
export  portions  of  the  failed  wheel-through  transaction will be 
calculated
separately,  as though they were separate failed transactions.  The sum of 
those
impacts  shall  be  billed  to  the Market Participant that scheduled the 
failed
wheel-through  transaction  as  the  financial  impact of causing the failure 
to
complete checkout of the transaction.

Implementation Rules


1.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
delivered to the NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity
selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the
scheduling entity?s BME Bid Price, and buying the energy that was not 
delivered
from the LBMP Market at the Real-Time LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy
Generator Bus.  No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is
shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control 
Area
and the energy was not delivered due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
delivering Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the 
Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is lower
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to deliver scheduled energy.

2.   An External Transaction for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
received from NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity 
buying
the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling
entity?s BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP
Market at the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus.  No payment
will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External
Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not
taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
receiving Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is 
higher
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to take scheduled energy.

3.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at one
external Proxy Generator Bus and the delivery of energy from the NYCA at a
different external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which 
no
energy is delivered to or received from the NYCA in real-time, will be settled
by applying rules 1 and 2 of this ECA separately to the failed delivery of
energy to the import Proxy Generator Bus and the failed receipt of energy at 
the
export Proxy Generator Bus, and summing the total of the two amounts for 
payment
by the scheduling entity.  No payment will be required by the scheduling 
entity
if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each
Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an
error or action by the NYISO or the delivering or receiving Control Area.  No
payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant for the import 
or
the export portion of the External Transaction if no payment would have been
required had that portion of the transaction been a separate transaction under
rule 1 or 2 of this ECA.

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

The architect that has begun to work on the project is Kipp Flores.  They are 
in Austin.

Thank you for your time this evening.  Your comments were very helpful.  I 
appreciate you and Greg taking a look at this project.

Subject:	Redacted Consulting Agreements

Covinton & Burling were furnished with redacted Consulting Agreements (they specifically mentioned an E&Y agreement).  They need to get unredacted versions to determine what there obligations would be going forward.  Could you give me copies to supply them with.  I will need to make copies for the data room.  We may not leave them in there, but need to have copies for serious parties going forward.  Thanks.

Dear Sally:

I am a new member of Jay Webb's EnronOnline technical team.  In my role, I 
have had the opportunity to review the EOL Reporting Database created by 
Eugenio Perez.  Eugenio has demonstrated good technical and problem solving 
skills in the development of the Reporting Database.  He was able to apply 
his knowledge of Microsoft Access and expand his programming skills.  He 
quickly developed an application that served the immediate needs of EOL.  
Eugenio should be commended for growing his technical skills to develop his 
first Access application.

Sincerely,
Chris

Subject: Update on Confirm Logic

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last 
week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  
Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we 
can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that 
participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra 
participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy 
immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant 
called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.

This is a reminder of the GBN steering committee meeting this Sunday, 4:30 pm 
at Guadalajara.

Looking forward to seeing you,

Glenn.


GBN Steering Committee Meeting, 09 April 2000
May 17th Speaker - no sponsor.We decided against having a cover charge and to 
use GBN funds. We felt a cover might reduce attendance and wanted to keep the 
speaker series free for attendees. A $10 cover wouldn't cover all of the 
expenses anyway and we felt it would create a bad impression. Deed Vest of 
Rockwell International has confirmed availability for the date. Carolyn is 
handling the set up.
September 20th Houston's Economy PanelPaul Murphy, Southwest Bank of Texas: 
confirmed with sponsorshipShirley Delibero, Metro: unconfirmed, should hear 
something this weekRobert Duncan, Transwestern Real Estate: confirmedHarvey 
Bunce, UT Galveston Med Center: unconfirmedTechnology: need someone. Roger, 
any interest at Compaq?Energy: need someone. Sally, any interest at Enron?
Moderator: UT Professor Michael Brandl, Ph.D.
I will be contacting the TBN and see if they would also like to attend. This 
will be a GBN event, but we will invite the TBN.

June 25th Astros night v. San FranciscoAccording to Chrissy, the plans 
include a ticket to the? game, dinner at Zydeco's and a trolley ride from 
Zydeco's to the new Enron field. All this for only $25/person! Chrissy, if 
you have the info, let's try to get it on the May 17th event mailing.

Summer 2000 Family EventSeveral members have expressed interest in a family 
event. Chrissy and I are looking into Theater Under The Stars (Miller Outdoor 
Theater). GBN will buy soft drinks and attendees will bring their own picnic 
dinner.

All,

There has been some concern about the lack of clarity regarding what 
functionality is ready for user acceptance testing in the staging 
environment.  To attempt to solve this problem, we have come up with a simple 
process that will enhance communication and will allow everyone on the team 
to know what functionality is in staging waiting for user acceptance signoff 
prior to a release to production.  Please read the attached one page document 
that details the proposed process.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Zach

CSFB informed us today that their Appalachia hedging deal will likely happen 
in the next two weeks. The deal, in short, involves Enron buying an average 
volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 
month from Dec00. 
CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a 
spreadsheet that details the volumes, which decline with time. Could you 
please provide indicative prices, as of tonight's close. 
Thanks,
Russ

Sorry I didn't get back with you sooner! I didn't check my e-mail until last
night (Thurs). I did try to call you on Sunday, but I hung up when I
remembered you were with the guys! It wasn't a big deal! I hope you have a
good weekend!

Michelle,

I would appreciate it if you would call Mark and get the local counsel mater
resolved. ODNSS' recommendations/suggestions on a variety of matters and
their support activity for NEPCO over the last couple of years has been well
received and valued by our internal clients. Thanks.

Mike

David,

For clarification, I was present during Mark Stubley's brief training
session over the phone.  I memorialized the key points in a summary email.
Let me know if you or anyone else would like a copy of it.

On the issue of Ogletree training, I had mentioned that it might be more
cost efficient to have someone in Florida conduct the training.  Mike had
indicated a preference to use Mark Stubley at Ogletree.  Of course, since
Mark has done it for us in the past, I am ok with him doing it as well.  I
just was looking at the outside expenditures, as we all have been doing
lately (particularly outside counsel bills), and thought that there may be
some cost savings.  In some circumstances, outside counsel who have to
travel cut their rates a bit for travel time (don't know if Stubley does
that), so the cost differential could be minimal, but I thought I'd raise it
since there are qualified attorneys in Florida who could assist in that
arena.

I'll give Mark a call to finalize the issue of local counsel, which I do not
believe to be significant.  Because Mark has contacted them, they already
have run a conflict check and are ready to go.  All it would take to get
them "engaged" would be a phone call.  There should not be any cost incurred
at this point, because they only are on standby, so I think it is good to
line them up.  I'll let you know if Jim Derrick has any issue with their
recommendation.  I also have received recommendations for top-notch local
labor counsel in Florida if we choose to go that route.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Mike,

I know of no hold up here.  I spoke to Michelle Cash and she had not

withheld or said different to retaining this counsel.  I would suggest that

you call Michelle (713-853-6401) anytime you have a concern with regard to

the progress of any labor and employment matter handled by outside or inside

counsel.  And if Stubley is concerned about who he would like to work with

in Florida, he is equally able to call Michelle and discuss it.

As for a review of the training on union avoidance by Ogletree Deakins, by

copy to Michelle, I'll ask for her input here.

I saw the correspondence from Mr. Fitzgerald regarding his meeting with the

Mayor of Lake Worth.  I interpret this as a public official saying what is

expected, neither favoring the picketers or us, just saying he will up-hold

the law.  We appreciate that.

                I forwarded our recommendation for local counsel to Michelle

Cash. She

                indicated that Enron might want to use another firm. In the

meantime, we

                will continue to use Cole Fitzgerald.  On September 24, I

copied you (as

                well as Michelle Cash and David Lund) on Cole's

correspondence concerning

                his meeting with the mayor of Lake Worth. So, his

connections should prove

                helpful.

                Lund has provided me a copy of NEPCO's subcontract. Our

review and comments

                should be complete by Friday.

                We conducted the quick, over-the-phone training for the

management team at

                Lake Worth approximately two weeks ago.  We agreed to

conduct on-site

                training when more of the project management team is present

at the site. No

                specific time is scheduled.

                We have not received a plat for the project. We have not

determined the gate

                setup. We have determined, however, that all construction

traffic and

                deliveries would use the southern gate, not the main gate to

the facility.

Sheila,

Several follow up comments/questions:

1) On the carve-out for investment banking, the restriction on similar transactions is very broad, particularly given the general applicability of the deals we work on - raising capital in the 144A, public or debt markets, corporate revolvers, leasing, monetizations, etc..  I would agree that I should not be able to work on a deal that I was working on as a direct competitor (say ENE was executing a pre-pay with a client - I would not be able to go to an investment bank and compete for the same deal), but to put in a restriction on general corporate finance type activity seems overly broad.  Can you confirm that the concept is that not to compete on deals I have been working on.

2) I would like to discuss the assignment language further.  I do not have an issue with assignment to an affiliate, my issue is with the ability to assign to any other entity.  Based on how the contract is drafted, ENE could assign the contract to anyone, including in the extreme say 7-Eleven.  Not that I would expect this to happen and I understand that I would be getting paid during the time period, however, the work that I could be doing or firm working for, could make me unemployable beyond the contract period.  I am signing this contract and agreeing to stay with ENE or an affiliate, not any other entity.  What is the definition of affiliate (is this the same as used in the typical ENE docs, which ties to control) ?

3) On vesting.  My view is that I am signing a 2 year contract and the compensation should vest during that period (i.e. 1/3 now, 1/3 after 1 year and 1/3 at the end of the 2nd year, or 50% after yr. 1 and 50% after yr. 2) I would like to discuss your thoughts on this issue.

Thanks,

George

George, talked with Legal and the determination is as follows: 

	Employee would be able to work for other companies but would not be able to work on similar transactions for the non-compete period.  

Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Subject:	RE: 


as a clarification:

- based on the language below, if I took a position as an investment banker for a firm such as Barclays, CSFB, a hedge fund, a consulting firm or venture capital firm (i.e. not a company such as El Paso), I would not be prohibited from working on deals (even deals that are similar to those I worked on for Enron) for companies involved in the busineses outlined in section 3.4 a thru d. ?

the distinction is important because the types of firms listed above are involved in many of the activities involved in section 3.4 a thru d, with clients that are involved in these activities.

Thanks,

George
